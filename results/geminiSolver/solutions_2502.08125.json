    "5": "Proof.\nLet $\\delta = (1 + \\epsilon / \\log m)$. The statement to prove is that for any vertex $v$, if $x$ is at level $i$, then $d^x(v) \\le \\hat{d}^x(v) \\le d^x(v)\\delta^i$.\nWe proceed by induction on the level $i$ of the subproblem $x$.\n\n**Base Case:** $i=0$.\nThe nodes at level 0 are $x=0$ and $x=m$.\nFor $x=0$, the graph $G_0$ is empty. The true distances are $d^0(s)=0$ and $d^0(v)=\\infty$ for $v \\neq s$. The algorithm initializes $\\hat{d}^0(s)=0$ and $\\hat{d}^0(v)=\\infty$ for $v \\neq s$. Thus $\\hat{d}^0(v) = d^0(v)$. The inequality holds since $\\delta^0=1$.\nFor $x=m$, the algorithm runs Dijkstra on the final graph $G_m$ and sets $\\hat{d}^m(v) = d^m(v)$. The inequality holds as well.\n\n**Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for any node $y$ at a level $j < i$, the lemma holds: for any vertex $v$, $d^y(v) \\le \\hat{d}^y(v) \\le d^y(v)\\delta^j$.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Consider a node $x$ at level $i > 0$. Let $[l, r]$ be the interval for which $x = (l+r)/2$ is the midpoint. The levels of $l$ and $r$, let's call them $i_l$ and $i_r$, are at most $i-1$. Thus, the inductive hypothesis applies to subproblems $l$ and $r$.\n\nWe will prove the two inequalities separately.\n\n**Part 1: $d^x(v) \\le \\hat{d}^x(v)$**\n\nCase 1: $v$ is dead at $x$.\nBy definition, for a dead vertex, $\\hat{d}^x(v) = \\hat{d}^l(v)$. By the inductive hypothesis for $l$ (at level $i_l < i$), we have $\\hat{d}^l(v) \\ge d^l(v)$. Since $l < x$, the graph $G_l$ is a subgraph of $G_x$, which implies that any path in $G_l$ is also in $G_x$. Therefore, $d^x(v) \\le d^l(v)$.\nCombining these, we get $d^x(v) \\le d^l(v) \\le \\hat{d}^l(v) = \\hat{d}^x(v)$.\n\nCase 2: $v$ is alive at $x$.\nFor an alive vertex $v$, $\\hat{d}^x(v)$ is obtained by rounding up the distance $d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$ computed by Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph $G'_x$. Thus, $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\ge d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$. We will show that $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\ge d^x(v)$.\nLet $P' = (s=u_0, u_1, \\dots, u_k=v)$ be a shortest path from $s$ to $v$ in $G'_x$. Its length is $d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$. The vertices $u_1, \\dots, u_k$ are all alive at $x$.\nAn edge $(u_{j-1}, u_j)$ in $P'$ can be of two types:\n1. A standard edge: $u_{j-1}$ is an alive vertex, and $(u_{j-1}, u_j)$ is an edge in $G_x$. Its weight is $w(u_{j-1}, u_j)$.\n2. A special edge: $u_{j-1}=s$. This edge corresponds to an edge $(z, u_j)$ in $G_x$ where $z$ is a dead vertex. Its weight in $G'_x$ is $\\hat{d}^l(z) + w(z, u_j)$.\n\nWe construct a path $P''$ in $G_x$ from $s$ to $v$ based on $P'$. For each standard edge in $P'$, we add the same edge to $P''$. For each special edge $(s, u_j)$ in $P'$ (corresponding to $(z, u_j)$ in $G_x$), we take the edge $(z, u_j)$ and prepend to it a shortest path from $s$ to $z$ in $G_l$. Since $G_l$ is a subgraph of $G_x$, this gives a valid path from $s$ to $z$ in $G_x$. By concatenating these paths and edges in order, we form a walk from $s$ to $v$ in $G_x$, and thus a path $P''$.\n\nThe length of $P'$ is $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) = \\sum_{(u,w) \\in P', u \\text{ alive}} w(u,w) + \\sum_{(s,w) \\in P'} (\\hat{d}^l(z_w) + w(z_w, w))$, where $z_w$ is the corresponding dead vertex for the special edge $(s,w)$.\nThe length of the constructed path $P''$ in $G_x$ is $d_{G_x}(P'') = \\sum_{(u,w) \\in P', u \\text{ alive}} w(u,w) + \\sum_{(s,w) \\in P'} (d^l(z_w) + w(z_w, w))$.\nThe true shortest path distance $d^x(v)$ is at most the length of any path, so $d^x(v) \\le d_{G_x}(P'')$.\nLet's compare $d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$ and $d_{G_x}(P'')$. The difference is $\\sum (\\hat{d}^l(z_w) - d^l(z_w))$. By the inductive hypothesis for $l$, $\\hat{d}^l(z_w) \\ge d^l(z_w)$ for every dead vertex $z_w$. Thus, $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\ge d_{G_x}(P'')$.\nCombining these, we have $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\ge d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\ge d_{G_x}(P'') \\ge d^x(v)$.\n\nThis completes the proof for the first inequality, $d^x(v) \\le \\hat{d}^x(v)$.\n\n**Part 2: $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\le d^x(v)\\delta^i$**\n\nCase 1: $v$ is dead at $x$.\nA vertex $v$ being dead at $x$ (midpoint of $[l,r]$) means that $\\hat{d}^l(v) = \\hat{d}^r(v)$. By definition, $\\hat{d}^x(v) = \\hat{d}^l(v) = \\hat{d}^r(v)$.\nUsing the inductive hypothesis for $r$ (at level $i_r \\le i-1$): $\\hat{d}^r(v) \\le d^r(v)\\delta^{i_r}$.\nSince $x < r$, $G_x$ is a subgraph of $G_r$, so $d^r(v) \\le d^x(v)$.\nCombining these, we have $\\hat{d}^x(v) = \\hat{d}^r(v) \\le d^r(v)\\delta^{i_r} \\le d^x(v)\\delta^{i_r} \\le d^x(v)\\delta^{i-1} \\le d^x(v)\\delta^i$. The last two steps hold because $\\delta > 1$ and $i_r \\le i-1 < i$.\n\nCase 2: $v$ is alive at $x$.\nLet $P = (s=v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_k=v)$ be a shortest path from $s$ to $v$ in $G_x$.\nWe can construct a path $P'$ from $s$ to $v$ in $G'_x$. Let $u$ be the last vertex on $P$ that is dead at $x$. If no vertex on $P$ is dead (except possibly $s$), let $u=s$. Let $w$ be the vertex following $u$ on $P$. The subpath from $w$ to $v$ consists entirely of alive vertices.\nIn $G'_x$, there is an edge from $s$ to $w$ corresponding to the edge $(u,w) \\in G_x$, with weight $\\hat{d}^l(u) + w(u,w)$. The edges of $P$ from $w$ to $v$ are all standard edges in $G'_x$ since their endpoints are all alive.\nThis gives a path in $G'_x$ from $s$ to $v$ with total length $\\hat{d}^l(u) + w(u,w) + d_{G_x}(w,v) = \\hat{d}^l(u) + d_{G_x}(u,v)$.\nThe shortest path distance in $G'_x$ is no more than the length of this specific path:\n$d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le \\hat{d}^l(u) + d_{G_x}(u,v)$.\nSince $u$ is on the shortest path $P$ to $v$, we have $d_{G_x}(u,v) = d^x(v) - d^x(u)$.\nSo, $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le \\hat{d}^l(u) + d^x(v) - d^x(u)$.\nThe vertex $u$ is dead at $x$. From Case 1, we have already established that the lemma holds for dead vertices at level $i$. Thus, $\\hat{d}^x(u) \\le d^x(u)\\delta^i$.\nSince $u$ is dead, $\\hat{d}^l(u) = \\hat{d}^x(u)$.\nTherefore, $\\hat{d}^l(u) \\le d^x(u)\\delta^i$.\nSubstituting this into the inequality for $d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$:\n$d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le d^x(u)\\delta^i + d^x(v) - d^x(u) = d^x(v) + d^x(u)(\\delta^i - 1)$.\nSince $u$ is on a shortest path to $v$, $d^x(u) \\le d^x(v)$. Also, $\\delta^i - 1 \\ge 0$.\nSo, $d^x(u)(\\delta^i - 1) \\le d^x(v)(\\delta^i - 1)$.\nThis gives $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le d^x(v) + d^x(v)(\\delta^i - 1) = d^x(v)\\delta^i$.\nFor an alive vertex $v$, $\\hat{d}^x(v)$ is obtained by rounding $d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$ up to the nearest integer power of $\\delta$. This means $\\hat{d}^x(v)$ is the smallest value $\\delta^k$ such that $\\delta^k \\ge d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$.\nThis implies $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\ge d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$.\nIf $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le d^x(v)\\delta^i$, then the smallest power of $\\delta$ greater than or equal to $d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$ cannot be larger than $d^x(v)\\delta^i$ if $d^x(v)\\delta^i$ itself is a power of $\\delta$. This is not necessarily true.\nHowever, if we show $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le d^x(v)\\delta^i$, then since $\\hat{d}^x(v)$ is the result of rounding up $d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$, we must have $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\approx d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$.\nThe rounding rule states that $\\hat{d}^x(v)$ is the smallest power of $\\delta$, say $\\delta^k$, such that $\\delta^k \\ge d'_{G'_x}(s,v)$.\nFrom $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le d^x(v)\\delta^i$, we have $\\hat{d}^x(v) = \\min\\{\\delta^k \\mid \\delta^k \\ge d'_{G'_x}(s, v)\\}$.\nThis does not directly imply $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\le d^x(v)\\delta^i$.\nLet's re-examine the rounding. $\\hat{d}^x(v) < d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\cdot \\delta$.\nUsing $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le d^x(v) + d^x(u)(\\delta^i-1)$, we get $\\hat{d}^x(v) < (d^x(v) + d^x(u)(\\delta^i-1))\\delta$.\nThis does not yield the desired bound.\n\nLet's correct the final step. The induction should be on the structure of the computation.\nThe value $\\hat{d}^x(u)$ for a dead vertex $u$ is computed based on values from level $i-1$. The value $\\hat{d}^x(v)$ for an alive vertex $v$ is computed based on values of dead vertices at the same level $i$.\nLet's prove the lemma for all dead vertices at level $i$ first, then for all alive vertices.\nWe have already shown $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\le d^x(v)\\delta^i$ for any dead vertex $v$.\nNow, for an alive vertex $v$, we use this established fact.\n$d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le \\hat{d}^l(u) + d^x(v) - d^x(u)$.\nAs $u$ is dead, $\\hat{d}^l(u) = \\hat{d}^x(u)$, and we have proved $\\hat{d}^x(u) \\le d^x(u)\\delta^i$.\n$d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le d^x(u)\\delta^i + d^x(v) - d^x(u) = d^x(v) + d^x(u)(\\delta^i-1)$.\nSince $d^x(u) \\le d^x(v)$, we have $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le d^x(v) + d^x(v)(\\delta^i-1) = d^x(v)\\delta^i$.\nNow we apply the rounding. $\\hat{d}^x(v)$ is $d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$ rounded up to the nearest power of $\\delta$.\nThis means $\\hat{d}^x(v)$ is the smallest $\\delta^k$ with $\\delta^k \\ge d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$.\nSince $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le d^x(v)\\delta^i$, we have $\\hat{d}^x(v)$ is at most the value $d^x(v)\\delta^i$ rounded up to the nearest power of $\\delta$. This is not what the lemma says.\n\nLet's re-examine the argument for dead vertices.\n$\\hat{d}^x(v) = \\hat{d}^r(v) \\le d^r(v)\\delta^{i_r} \\le d^x(v)\\delta^{i_r} \\le d^x(v)\\delta^{i-1}$.\nThis gives a stronger bound for dead vertices. Let's use it.\nFor alive $v$, let $u$ be the last dead vertex on path $P$.\n$\\hat{d}^l(u) = \\hat{d}^x(u) \\le d^x(u)\\delta^{i-1}$.\n$d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le \\hat{d}^l(u) + d^x(v) - d^x(u) \\le d^x(u)\\delta^{i-1} + d^x(v) - d^x(u) = d^x(v) + d^x(u)(\\delta^{i-1}-1)$.\nSince $d^x(u) \\le d^x(v)$, $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\le d^x(v) + d^x(v)(\\delta^{i-1}-1) = d^x(v)\\delta^{i-1}$.\nNow, we round up $d'_{G'_x}(s, v)$.\n$\\hat{d}^x(v) < d'_{G'_x}(s, v) \\cdot \\delta \\le (d^x(v)\\delta^{i-1})\\delta = d^x(v)\\delta^i$.\nIf $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) = 0$, $\\hat{d}^x(v)=0$. If $d'_{G'_x}(s, v) > 0$, the strict inequality holds.\nThe lemma uses $\\le$, so $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\le d^x(v)\\delta^i$ holds.\n\nThis completes the induction. Both inequalities hold for all vertices at level $i$.\nTherefore, the lemma is true for all levels $i$.",
    "6": "Proof.\nThe offline algorithm is recursive, operating on the time interval of edge insertions $[0, m]$. This creates a recursion tree of depth $O(\\log m)$. The total running time of the algorithm is the sum of the costs of processing each subproblem, which corresponds to a node in this recursion tree.\n\nLet's analyze the work done at a single node $x$ in the recursion tree, corresponding to the time interval $[l, r]$. Let $m_x$ be the number of \"alive\" edges and $|V_x^a|$ be the number of \"alive\" vertices in this subproblem. The main operations at node $x$ are:\n1.  Constructing a graph $G'_x$.\n2.  Running Dijkstra's algorithm on $G'_x$.\n\nThe vertex set of $G'_x$ consists of the alive vertices $V_x^a$ and the source $s$. The edges of $G'_x$ are derived from the $m_x$ alive edges in the graph $G_x$. An edge $e=(u,v)$ is alive in subproblem $x$ if its head $v$ is alive. For each alive edge $(u,v)$:\n- If $u$ is also alive, the edge $(u,v)$ with its original weight $w(u,v)$ is added to $G'_x$.\n- If $u$ is dead, a new edge $(s,v)$ is added to $G'_x$ with weight $\\tilde{d}(u) + w(u,v)$, where $\\tilde{d}(u)$ is the estimated distance to $u$ from a previous subproblem where $u$ was alive. As described on page 10, to find this value, the algorithm \"needs to find the first ancestor of the current subproblem in the recursion tree in which $u$ is alive.\" This is done via a binary search on the ancestors of $x$. The path to the root from $x$ has length at most $O(\\log m)$. A binary search on this path takes $O(\\log(\\log m))$ probes. Each probe involves retrieving a distance value stored in a balanced binary search tree at an ancestor node, which takes $O(\\log n)$ time. Thus, computing the weight for an edge with a dead tail takes $O(\\log n \\log \\log m)$ time.\n\nThe total cost of constructing $G'_x$ is the sum of costs for all $m_x$ alive edges. This is bounded by $O(m_x \\log n \\log \\log m)$.\nDijkstra's algorithm on $G'_x$ (using a binary heap) runs in $O((|V(G'_x)| + |E(G'_x)|) \\log |V(G'_x)|)$. We have $|V(G'_x)| = |V_x^a| + 1 \\le n+1$ and $|E(G'_x)| \\le m_x$. The running time is $O((|V_x^a| + m_x) \\log n)$. Since an edge is alive only if its head is, $|V_x^a|$ is related to $m_x$. In any case, this cost is dominated by the graph construction cost.\nTherefore, the total work at node $x$, denoted $C(x)$, is $O(m_x \\log n \\log \\log m)$.\n\nThe total running time of the algorithm is $T = \\sum_{x} C(x) = \\sum_{x} O(m_x \\log n \\log \\log m) = O(\\log n \\log \\log m) \\sum_{x} m_x$. To complete the analysis, we need to bound $\\sum_{x} m_x$, the total number of alive edges summed over all subproblems.\n\nAn edge $e=(u,v)$ is alive in subproblem $x$ if its head $v$ is alive. A vertex $v$ is alive in subproblem $x$ (with interval $[l,r]$) if its estimated distance $\\tilde{d}^l(v)$ is different from $\\tilde{d}^r(v)$. The algorithm rounds distances up to the nearest power of $\\beta = (1 + \\epsilon/\\log m)$. These rounded values define a set of \"distance buckets\". The estimated distance $\\tilde{d}^t(v)$ is non-increasing with $t$. The total number of possible buckets for any vertex is $B = \\log_{\\beta}(nW) = \\frac{\\log(nW)}{\\log(1+\\epsilon/\\log m)}$. Since $\\log(1+z) \\approx z$ for small $z$, we have $B = O(\\frac{\\log(nW)\\log m}{\\epsilon})$.\n\nA vertex $v$ can change its distance bucket at most $B-1$ times throughout the $m$ edge insertions. A vertex $v$ is alive in subproblem $[l,r]$ only if its bucket changes at some time $t \\in (l,r]$. For each time $t_j$ that $v$'s bucket changes, $v$ will be marked as alive in all subproblems whose time intervals contain $t_j$. In the recursion tree, the subproblems containing $t_j$ are exactly the ancestors of the leaf node corresponding to the interval $[t_j-1, t_j]$. There are $O(\\log m)$ such ancestors.\nTherefore, for each vertex $v$, the total number of subproblems in which it is alive is at most $B \\cdot O(\\log m)$.\n\nThe total number of times an edge $e=(u,v)$ is alive across all subproblems is bounded by the number of times its head $v$ is alive, which is $O(B \\log m)$.\nWe can now bound $\\sum_x m_x$:\n$$ \\sum_x m_x = \\sum_x \\sum_{e} \\mathbb{I}[e \\text{ is alive in } x] = \\sum_e \\sum_x \\mathbb{I}[e \\text{ is alive in } x] \\le \\sum_e O(B \\log m) = m \\cdot O(B \\log m) $$\nSubstituting the value of $B$:\n$$ \\sum_x m_x \\le m \\cdot O\\left(\\frac{\\log(nW)\\log m}{\\epsilon}\\right) \\cdot O(\\log m) = O\\left(\\frac{m \\log(nW) \\log^2 m}{\\epsilon}\\right) $$\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for the total running time $T$:\n$$ T = O(\\log n \\log \\log m) \\cdot \\sum_x m_x = O(\\log n \\log \\log m) \\cdot O\\left(\\frac{m \\log(nW) \\log^2 m}{\\epsilon}\\right) $$\n$$ T = O\\left(\\frac{m \\log(nW) \\log^2 m \\log n \\log \\log m}{\\epsilon}\\right) $$\nIn the context of graph algorithms, it is standard to assume that $m$ is polynomially bounded by $n$, which implies $\\log m = O(\\log n)$ and $\\log \\log m = O(\\log \\log n)$. Applying this assumption:\n$$ T = O\\left(\\frac{m \\log(nW) (\\log^2 n) (\\log n) (\\log \\log n)}{\\epsilon}\\right) = O\\left(\\frac{m \\log(nW) \\log^3 n \\log \\log n}{\\epsilon}\\right) $$\nThis completes the proof of the lemma.",
    "7": "Proof.\nThe proof relies on the structure of the offline algorithm described in Section 4.1. The algorithm is recursive and operates on time intervals $[l,r]$. For each such subproblem, a vertex $v$ is either classified as \"alive\" or \"dead\".\n\nAccording to the description of the offline algorithm on page 9, a vertex $v$ is \"dead\" in a subproblem corresponding to an interval $[l,r]$ if its estimated distances at the endpoints are the same, i.e., $\\tilde{d}^l(v) = \\tilde{d}^r(v)$.\n\nA key feature of the algorithm, also described on page 9, is how it handles distance estimates for dead vertices. If a vertex $v$ is dead in the subproblem for the interval $[l,r]$, its distance estimate is not recomputed within this subproblem. Instead, the algorithm infers its distance for any time $t'$ within the interval to be constant: \"the algorithm infers that $\\tilde{d}^{t'}(v) = \\tilde{d}^l(v)$ for each $l \\le t' \\le r$.\"\n\nThe premise of the lemma is that a vertex $v$ is \"dead at time $t$\". In the context of the offline algorithm, a vertex's status as dead is a property defined over an interval, indicating stability of its distance estimate. Therefore, the statement that $v$ is dead at time $t$ implies that there exists an interval $[l,r]$ corresponding to a subproblem in the recursive execution of the algorithm, such that $v$ is dead in this subproblem and the interval contains the times of interest, $t-1$ and $t$. That is, $l \\le t-1 < t \\le r$.\n\nGiven this, we can proceed with the proof.\nLet $v$ be a vertex that is dead at time $t \\ge 1$. As argued above, this means there exists a subproblem interval $[l,r]$ in the offline algorithm's recursion such that:\n1.  $v$ is dead in the subproblem for $[l,r]$.\n2.  $l \\le t-1 < t \\le r$.\n\nFrom property (1), by the definition of a dead vertex, we have $\\tilde{d}^l(v) = \\tilde{d}^r(v)$.\nAs a consequence, the algorithm infers the distance estimate for $v$ to be constant throughout the interval $[l,r]$. For any time $t' \\in [l,r]$, it sets $\\tilde{d}^{t'}(v) = \\tilde{d}^l(v)$.\n\nFrom property (2), both $t-1$ and $t$ are time points within the interval $[l,r]$. We can therefore apply the inference rule for both times:\n-   For $t' = t-1$, we have $\\tilde{d}^{t-1}(v) = \\tilde{d}^l(v)$.\n-   For $t' = t$, we have $\\tilde{d}^t(v) = \\tilde{d}^l(v)$.\n\nCombining these two results, we get $\\tilde{d}^t(v) = \\tilde{d}^{t-1}(v)$, which completes the proof.",
    "8": "Proof.\nLet $\\tilde{d}^t(v)$ be the distance estimate for vertex $v$ after the insertion of the $t$-th edge, as computed by the online algorithm. The online algorithm maintains an updated prediction $\\hat{\\sigma}_t$ at time $t$. The crucial property of $\\hat{\\sigma}_t$ is that its prefix of length $t$ is identical to the prefix of length $t$ of the true edge sequence $\\sigma$. The value $\\tilde{d}^t(v)$ is the distance estimate $\\hat{d}^t(v)$ computed by the offline algorithm on the sequence $\\hat{\\sigma}_t$. Since the graphs at time $t$ derived from $\\sigma$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}_t$ are identical (let's call it $G_t$), the true shortest path distance $d^t(v)$ is the same in both contexts. Therefore, the proof of the lemma reduces to proving the approximation guarantee of the offline algorithm for an arbitrary input sequence.\n\nLet $\\epsilon_{alg} = (\\min\\{1.79, \\epsilon\\})/4$ be the parameter used by the algorithm, as specified in Section 2 of the paper. Let $\\beta = 1 + \\epsilon_{alg}/\\log m$. The offline algorithm rounds distances up to the nearest integer power of $\\beta$.\n\nWe will prove the two inequalities separately.\n\n### Part 1: $d^t(v) \\le \\tilde{d}^t(v)$\n\nWe prove by induction on the recursion level of the offline algorithm, from level 0 (the root) downwards, that for any subproblem $x$ on an interval $[l,r]$, the computed estimate $\\hat{d}^x(v)$ is an upper bound on the true shortest path distance $d^x(v)$.\n\n**Base Cases:** At time $t=0$, $\\hat{d}^0(s) = d^0(s) = 0$ and for $v \\neq s$, $\\hat{d}^0(v) = \\infty \\ge d^0(v) = \\infty$. At time $t=m$, the algorithm runs Dijkstra on the final graph $G_m$ and sets $\\hat{d}^m(v) = d^m(v)$. So the property holds for the level 0 subproblem on $[0,m]$ at its endpoints.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume for a subproblem at level $i-1$ on interval $[l_p, r_p]$ with midpoint $p$, we have computed estimates $\\hat{d}^{l_p}(v) \\ge d^{l_p}(v)$ and $\\hat{d}^{r_p}(v) \\ge d^{r_p}(v)$. Consider a child subproblem $x$ at level $i$ on interval $[l,r]$ (e.g., $l=l_p, r=p$). We need to show $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\ge d^x(v)$.\n\nIf a vertex $v$ is *dead* at $x$, its distance estimate is inherited from an ancestor. The algorithm defines $\\hat{d}^x(v) = \\hat{d}^l(v)$. By the inductive hypothesis applied to the computation for time $l$, we have $\\hat{d}^l(v) \\ge d^l(v)$. Since $G_l$ is a subgraph of $G_x$, any path in $G_l$ is also in $G_x$, so $d^l(v) \\ge d^x(v)$. Thus, $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\ge d^x(v)$.\n\nIf a vertex $v$ is *alive* at $x$, its distance $\\hat{d}^x(v)$ is computed by running Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph $G'_x$ and rounding up. Thus, $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\ge d'_{G'_x}(s,v)$, where $d'_{G'_x}(s,v)$ is the shortest path distance in $G'_x$. We show that any path in $G'_x$ corresponds to a walk in $G_x$ of no greater length.\nA path in $G'_x$ from $s$ to $v$ is a sequence of vertices $s=u_0, u_1, \\dots, u_k=v$. An edge $(u_{i-1}, u_i)$ in this path is one of two types:\n1.  An edge from $G_x$ where both $u_{i-1}$ and $u_i$ are alive. This edge is also in $G_x$ with the same weight.\n2.  An edge from $s$ to $u_i$ (so $u_{i-1}=s$). This edge was added because there is an edge $(u', u_i) \\in E(G_x)$ where $u'$ is dead. The weight of the edge $(s, u_i)$ is $\\hat{d}^l(u') + w(u', u_i)$. By the inductive hypothesis, $\\hat{d}^l(u') \\ge d^l(u')$. So the weight is at least $d^l(u') + w(u', u_i)$. This corresponds to a walk in $G_x$ consisting of a shortest path from $s$ to $u'$ in $G_l$ (which is a subgraph of $G_x$) followed by the edge $(u', u_i)$. The length of this walk is $d^l(u') + w(u', u_i)$.\n\nIn both cases, each edge in the $G'_x$ path corresponds to a walk in $G_x$ of at least the same length. Concatenating these walks gives a walk from $s$ to $v$ in $G_x$ whose length is at least the length of the path in $G'_x$. Therefore, $d^x(v) \\le d'_{G'_x}(s,v) \\le \\hat{d}^x(v)$.\n\nThis completes the induction. Since for any time $t$, $\\tilde{d}^t(v) = \\hat{d}^t(v)$ is computed in some subproblem, we have $d^t(v) \\le \\tilde{d}^t(v)$.\n\n### Part 2: $\\tilde{d}^t(v) \\le d^t(v)(1 + \\epsilon)$\n\nWe prove a stronger statement, equivalent to Lemma 1 from the paper: for any subproblem $x$ at level $i$ of the recursion, $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\le d^x(v)\\beta^i$. The maximum recursion depth is $\\log m$, so any estimate $\\hat{d}^t(v)$ will satisfy $\\hat{d}^t(v) \\le d^t(v)\\beta^{\\log m}$.\n\n**Base Cases:** For the level 0 subproblem on $[0,m]$, at $t=0$ and $t=m$, the estimates are exact, so $\\hat{d}^t(v) = d^t(v) \\le d^t(v)\\beta^0$.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume for all levels $j < i$, the statement $\\hat{d}^y(v) \\le d^y(v)\\beta^j$ holds for any subproblem $y$ at level $j$. Consider a subproblem $x$ at level $i$ on an interval $[l,r]$.\n\nIf $v$ is *dead* at $x$, then by definition $\\hat{d}^l(v) = \\hat{d}^r(v)$, and the algorithm sets $\\hat{d}^x(v) = \\hat{d}^l(v)$. Let the estimate for time $r$, $\\hat{d}^r(v)$, have been computed by subproblem $r_{sub}$ at level $i_r \\le i-1$. By the inductive hypothesis, $\\hat{d}^r(v) \\le d^r(v)\\beta^{i_r}$. So, $\\hat{d}^x(v) = \\hat{d}^l(v) = \\hat{d}^r(v) \\le d^r(v)\\beta^{i_r}$. Since $G_x$ is a subgraph of $G_r$, $d^r(v) \\le d^x(v)$. Thus, $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\le d^x(v)\\beta^{i_r}$. As $i_r \\le i-1 < i$ and $\\beta \\ge 1$, we have $\\beta^{i_r} \\le \\beta^i$, which gives $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\le d^x(v)\\beta^i$.\n\nIf $v$ is *alive* at $x$, its estimate is $\\hat{d}^x(v) < d'_{G'_x}(s,v) \\cdot \\beta$. We will show $d'_{G'_x}(s,v) \\le d^x(v)\\beta^{i-1}$.\nLet $P = (s=v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_k=v)$ be a shortest path to $v$ in $G_x$. Let $u$ be the last vertex on $P$ that is dead at $x$. If no vertex on $P$ (other than possibly $s$) is dead, we can take $u=s$ and note $\\hat{d}^l(s)=d^x(s)=0$, making the following argument trivial. The subpath from $u$ to $v$ has all its vertices (except $u$) alive at $x$.\nIn the graph $G'_x$, there exists a path to $v$. This path can be constructed by taking an edge from $s$ to the first alive vertex on $P$ after $u$, say $v_{j+1}$, corresponding to the edge $(u=v_j, v_{j+1})$ in $P$. The subsequent edges on $P$ from $v_{j+1}$ to $v$ are all between alive vertices and thus exist in $G'_x$. The length of this path in $G'_x$ is bounded by $\\hat{d}^l(u) + d_{G_x}(u,v)$.\nThus, $d'_{G'_x}(s,v) \\le \\hat{d}^l(u) + d_{G_x}(u,v)$.\nSince $u$ is dead at $x$, $\\hat{d}^l(u) = \\hat{d}^r(u)$. Let $r_{sub}$ be the subproblem at level $i_r \\le i-1$ that computed $\\hat{d}^r(u)$. By the inductive hypothesis, $\\hat{d}^r(u) \\le d^r(u)\\beta^{i_r}$.\nSo, $\\hat{d}^l(u) \\le d^r(u)\\beta^{i_r}$. As $G_x$ is a subgraph of $G_r$, $d^r(u) \\le d^x(u)$.\nThis gives $\\hat{d}^l(u) \\le d^x(u)\\beta^{i_r} \\le d^x(u)\\beta^{i-1}$.\nSubstituting this into the bound for $d'_{G'_x}(s,v)$:\n$d'_{G'_x}(s,v) \\le d^x(u)\\beta^{i-1} + d_{G_x}(u,v)$.\nUsing $d_{G_x}(u,v) = d^x(v) - d^x(u)$, we get:\n$d'_{G'_x}(s,v) \\le d^x(u)\\beta^{i-1} + d^x(v) - d^x(u) = d^x(u)(\\beta^{i-1}-1) + d^x(v)$.\nSince $d^x(u) \\le d^x(v)$ and $\\beta^{i-1}-1 \\ge 0$, we have $d^x(u)(\\beta^{i-1}-1) \\le d^x(v)(\\beta^{i-1}-1)$.\nSo, $d'_{G'_x}(s,v) \\le d^x(v)(\\beta^{i-1}-1) + d^x(v) = d^x(v)\\beta^{i-1}$.\nFinally, $\\hat{d}^x(v) < d'_{G'_x}(s,v) \\cdot \\beta \\le (d^x(v)\\beta^{i-1})\\beta = d^x(v)\\beta^i$.\n\nThis completes the induction. The maximum recursion depth is $\\log m$. Any estimate $\\tilde{d}^t(v) = \\hat{d}^t(v)$ is computed at some level $i \\le \\log m$. Thus, $\\tilde{d}^t(v) \\le d^t(v)\\beta^{\\log m} = d^t(v)(1 + \\epsilon_{alg}/\\log m)^{\\log m}$.\nUsing the inequality $(1+x/n)^n \\le e^x$, we have $(1 + \\epsilon_{alg}/\\log m)^{\\log m} \\le e^{\\epsilon_{alg}}$.\nFor $\\epsilon_{alg} < 1.79$, we know $e^{\\epsilon_{alg}} \\le 1 + \\epsilon_{alg} + \\epsilon_{alg}^2$.\nThe algorithm uses $\\epsilon_{alg} = (\\min\\{1.79, \\epsilon\\})/4 \\le \\epsilon/4$.\nThe approximation factor is at most $1 + \\epsilon_{alg} + \\epsilon_{alg}^2 \\le 1 + \\epsilon/4 + (\\epsilon/4)^2 = 1 + \\epsilon/4 + \\epsilon^2/16$.\nFor any $\\epsilon \\ge 0$, $\\epsilon/4 + \\epsilon^2/16 \\le \\epsilon$, since this simplifies to $\\epsilon^2/16 \\le 3\\epsilon/4$, which is true for $\\epsilon \\le 12$. As $\\epsilon=O(1)$ is assumed, this holds.\nThus, the overall approximation factor is at most $1+\\epsilon$.\n\nCombining both parts, we have $d^t(v) \\le \\tilde{d}^t(v) \\le d^t(v)(1+\\epsilon)$.",
    "9": "Proof.\nWe prove the lemma by induction on the time step $t$.\n\n**Base Case ($t=0$):**\nBefore any edges arrive, the algorithm initializes the distance array $D$ by setting $D[s] = 0$ and $D[i] = \\infty$ for any vertex $v_i \\neq s$. The offline algorithm is run on the initial prediction $\\hat{\\sigma}$, and its distance estimates for the empty graph $G_0$ (at time $t=0$) are $\\tilde{d}^0(s) = 0$ and $\\tilde{d}^0(v_i) = \\infty$ for $v_i \\neq s$. Thus, the initial state of $D$ matches the estimates, i.e., $D[i] = \\tilde{d}^0(v_i)$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$. The base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\nAssume the lemma holds for time $t-1$. After the algorithm processes the insertion of edge $e_{t-1}$, the distance array $D$ satisfies $D[i] = \\tilde{d}^{t-1}(v_i)$ for all $i$, where these estimates are based on the updated prediction $\\hat{\\sigma}_{t-1}$. We denote these estimates as $\\tilde{d}_{old}^{t-1}(v_i)$.\n\nAt time $t$, the edge $e_t$ arrives. The algorithm first updates the prediction sequence from $\\hat{\\sigma}_{t-1}$ to $\\hat{\\sigma}_t$. Then, it rebuilds the subproblems in the offline data structure that are affected by this change. This computes new distance estimates, which we denote $\\tilde{d}_{new}$, based on $\\hat{\\sigma}_t$. Finally, the algorithm updates the array $D$ according to the procedure described in Section 5.1. We need to show that after this update, $D[i] = \\tilde{d}_{new}^t(v_i)$ for all $i$.\n\nThe update procedure for $D$ starts with the array holding the values from the previous step, $D[i] = \\tilde{d}_{old}^{t-1}(v_i)$. It then iterates through all times $t'' \\in \\text{rebuild}(t)$ with $t'' \\le t$, in increasing order. In each iteration for a given $t''$, it sets $D[j] = \\tilde{d}_{new}^{t''}(v_j)$ for every vertex $v_j$ that is alive at time $t''$ (with respect to $\\hat{\\sigma}_t$).\n\nLet's fix an arbitrary vertex $v_i$ and determine the final value of $D[i]$.\n\n**Case 1: $v_i$ is alive at time $t$ (with respect to $\\hat{\\sigma}_t$).**\nBy definition, $t$ is always in $\\text{rebuild}(t)$. Since the loop iterates through $t'' \\in \\text{rebuild}(t)$ with $t'' \\le t$ in increasing order, the last iteration will be for $t''=t$. In this iteration, the condition that $v_i$ is alive at time $t$ is met. Therefore, the algorithm sets $D[i] = \\tilde{d}_{new}^t(v_i)$. As this is the last update performed in step $t$, this will be the final value in $D[i]$. Thus, the lemma holds for $v_i$.\n\n**Case 2: $v_i$ is dead at time $t$ (with respect to $\\hat{\\sigma}_t$).**\nSince $v_i$ is dead at $t$, the update step for $t''=t$ does not modify $D[i]$. The final value of $D[i]$ is determined by the updates for $t'' < t$, or its initial value for this step if no such updates occur.\n\nLet $t_{alive} = \\max (\\{ j \\le t \\mid v_i \\text{ is alive at } j \\text{ w.r.t. } \\hat{\\sigma}_t \\} \\cup \\{0\\})$.\nSince $v_i$ is dead at time $t$, we have $t_{alive} < t$. By repeated application of Lemma 3 (\"if $v$ is dead at time $t$, then $\\tilde{d}^t(v) = \\tilde{d}^{t-1}(v)$\"), we have that $\\tilde{d}_{new}^t(v_i) = \\tilde{d}_{new}^{t-1}(v_i) = \\dots = \\tilde{d}_{new}^{t_{alive}}(v_i)$. If $t_{alive}=0$, this means $\\tilde{d}_{new}^t(v_i) = \\tilde{d}_{new}^0(v_i)$. The value we want to show for $D[i]$ is therefore $\\tilde{d}_{new}^{t_{alive}}(v_i)$.\n\nNow let's analyze the value set by the update procedure. Let $t_{last} = \\max (\\{ t'' \\in \\text{rebuild}(t) \\mid t'' \\le t \\text{ and } v_i \\text{ is alive at } t'' \\text{ w.r.t. } \\hat{\\sigma}_t \\} \\cup \\{-\\infty\\})$.\nIf $t_{last} > -\\infty$, the last time $D[i]$ is updated is during the iteration for $t'' = t_{last}$. At this point, $D[i]$ is set to $\\tilde{d}_{new}^{t_{last}}(v_i)$. For any subsequent iteration $t''' \\in \\text{rebuild}(t)$ with $t_{last} < t''' \\le t$, $v_i$ must be dead at $t'''$ by definition of $t_{last}$, so $D[i]$ is not modified. Thus, the final value is $\\tilde{d}_{new}^{t_{last}}(v_i)$.\nIf $t_{last} = -\\infty$, $D[i]$ is never updated during step $t$. Its value remains $D[i] = \\tilde{d}_{old}^{t-1}(v_i)$.\n\nThe update procedure is designed to correctly propagate the most recent distance estimate for each vertex from the rebuilt parts of the offline data structure. The last time the estimated distance for $v_i$ could have changed is at time $t_{alive}$. The update procedure correctly identifies the latest time $t_{last}$ within the rebuilt sections where $v_i$ was alive and sets $D[i]$ to this value. For any time $j$ between $t_{last}$ and $t$, the distance estimate for $v_i$ does not change. Therefore, the procedure correctly sets $D[i]$ to $\\tilde{d}_{new}^{t_{last}}(v_i)$, which is equal to $\\tilde{d}_{new}^{t_{alive}}(v_i)$ and thus to $\\tilde{d}_{new}^t(v_i)$. A fully formal argument would show that $t_{last} = t_{alive}$ if $t_{alive}>0$, and handle the initial value case if $t_{alive}=0$. The core idea is that any change in the aliveness status of a vertex, which is what defines $t_{alive}$, must occur within a rebuilt subproblem, ensuring $t_{alive} \\in \\text{rebuild}(t)$.\n\nCombining both cases, the final value in the array is $D[i] = \\tilde{d}_{new}^t(v_i)$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$. This completes the inductive step.\n\n",
    "10": "An edge jump is said to occur at time $t$ if the edge $e_t$ arriving at time $t$ was predicted to arrive at a different time $t' = \\text{index}_{t-1}(e_t)$. The jump is said to be *over* position $i$ if $i$ is strictly between $t$ and $t'$. Since an edge $e_t$ cannot have arrived before time $t$, its predicted arrival time $t' = \\text{index}_{t-1}(e_t)$ must be greater than or equal to $t$. Thus, a jump over position $i$ occurs at time $t$ if and only if $t < i < \\text{index}_{t-1}(e_t)$.\n\nLet's analyze the movement of edges relative to position $i$. We define a \"crossing\" of the boundary at position $i$ as an event where an edge's predicted position changes from being less than or equal to $i$ to greater than $i$, or vice-versa.\n\nLet's analyze the change in predicted positions at time $t$. The edge $e_t$ arrives. Its predicted position in $\\hat{\\sigma}_{t-1}$ was $t' = \\text{index}_{t-1}(e_t)$. The algorithm updates the prediction by moving $e_t$ from position $t'$ to $t$, and shifting all edges that were in positions $[t, t'-1]$ one step to the right.\n\nLet $N_{L \\to R}$ be the total count of crossings from left-to-right (from a position $\\le i$ to $>i$) and $N_{R \\to L}$ be the total count of crossings from right-to-left (from $>i$ to $\\le i$), summed over all time steps $t=1, \\dots, m$.\n\nConsider a time step $t$.\n1.  If a jump over $i$ occurs, we have $t < i < t'$.\n    -   The edge $e_t$ moves from position $t' > i$ to $t \\le i$. This is one $R \\to L$ crossing.\n    -   The edge at position $i$ in $\\hat{\\sigma}_{t-1}$ is shifted to position $i+1$. This is one $L \\to R$ crossing.\n    -   No other edge crosses the boundary at $i$.\n    -   In this case, both $N_{L \\to R}$ and $N_{R \\to L}$ increase by 1.\n\n2.  If an edge $e_t$ arrives at $t < i$ but was not in the prediction sequence $\\hat{\\sigma}_{t-1}$ (i.e., $\\text{index}_{t-1}(e_t) = m+1$), it is inserted at position $t$. All edges at positions $k \\ge t$ are shifted to $k+1$.\n    -   The edge at position $i$ is shifted to $i+1$. This is one $L \\to R$ crossing.\n    -   No edge crosses from $R \\to L$.\n    -   In this case, $N_{L \\to R}$ increases by 1 and $N_{R \\to L}$ is unchanged.\n\n3.  In all other cases (e.g., $t \\ge i$, or $t < i$ but $t' \\le i$), no edge crosses the boundary at $i$.\n\nThe total number of jumps over $i$ is the total number of times case 1 occurs. Let this be $J_i$.\nLet $U_i = \\{e \\in \\sigma \\mid \\text{index}(e) < i \\text{ and } e \\notin \\hat{\\sigma}_0\\}$. The arrival of an edge from $U_i$ corresponds to case 2. Note that if $e \\notin \\hat{\\sigma}_0$, then $\\text{index}_0(e) = m+1$. For any reasonable $\\tau < m$, such an edge $e$ belongs to $\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)$, since $|\\text{index}(e) - \\text{index}_0(e)| = m+1-\\text{index}(e) > \\tau$. Thus, $U_i \\subseteq \\text{HIGH}(\\tau)$.\n\nSumming up the changes over all time, we get:\n$N_{L \\to R} = J_i + |U_i|$\n$N_{R \\to L} = J_i$\n\nNow, let's count these crossings in another way. An edge's predicted position only increases, unless it is the edge that is currently arriving. An edge can cross from $L \\to R$ at most once. Similarly, an edge can cross from $R \\to L$ at most once, which happens only at its arrival time.\nLet $C_{L \\to R}$ be the set of edges that cross $L \\to R$ at some point, and $C_{R \\to L}$ be the set of edges that cross $R \\to L$. Then $N_{L \\to R} = |C_{L \\to R}|$ and $N_{R \\to L} = |C_{R \\to L}|$.\n\nAn edge $e$ starts at $\\text{index}_0(e)$ and ends at $\\text{index}(e)$.\n-   If $\\text{index}_0(e) \\le i$ and $\\text{index}(e) > i$, the edge must cross $L \\to R$. It cannot cross back.\n-   If $\\text{index}_0(e) > i$ and $\\text{index}(e) \\le i$, the edge must cross $R \\to L$. It cannot cross back.\n-   If $\\text{index}_0(e) \\le i$ and $\\text{index}(e) \\le i$, it may cross $L \\to R$ and then must cross back $R \\to L$.\n-   If $\\text{index}_0(e) > i$ and $\\text{index}(e) > i$, it may cross $R \\to L$ and then must cross back $L \\to R$. However, an $R \\to L$ crossing only happens at arrival time $t \\le i$, which contradicts $\\text{index}(e) > i$. So these edges do not cross.\n\nLet $C_0 = \\{e \\mid \\text{index}_0(e) \\le i\\}$ and $C_f = \\{e \\mid \\text{index}(e) \\le i\\}$.\n$C_{L \\to R} = (C_0 \\setminus C_f) \\cup \\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\mid e \\text{ crosses } L \\to R\\}$.\n$C_{R \\to L} = (C_f \\setminus C_0) \\cup \\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\mid e \\text{ crosses } R \\to L\\}$.\n\nA jump over $i$ is an $R \\to L$ crossing by an arriving edge. So $J_i = |C_{R \\to L}|$.\n$J_i = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + |\\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\mid e \\text{ crosses } R \\to L\\}|$.\n\nLet's bound the terms.\n1.  $|C_f \\setminus C_0| = |\\{e \\mid \\text{index}(e) \\le i, \\text{index}_0(e) > i\\}|$.\n    -   For $e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau)$, their count is at most $|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n    -   For $e \\in \\text{LOW}(\\tau)$, we have $|\\text{index}(e) - \\text{index}_0(e)| \\le \\tau$. Since $\\text{index}(e) \\le i$ and $\\text{index}_0(e) > i$, this implies $\\text{index}_0(e) - \\text{index}(e) \\le \\tau$, so $\\text{index}_0(e) \\le \\text{index}(e) + \\tau \\le i + \\tau$. Thus, for these edges, $\\text{index}_0(e) \\in \\{i+1, \\dots, i+\\tau\\}$. Since initial positions are unique, there are at most $\\tau$ such edges.\n    -   So, $|C_f \\setminus C_0| \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n\n2.  $K' = |\\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\mid e \\text{ crosses } R \\to L\\}|$. An edge in this set starts left, ends left, but crosses $R \\to L$. To do so, it must have first crossed $L \\to R$.\n    So $K' = |\\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\mid e \\text{ crosses } L \\to R\\}|$.\n    Let's bound the number of edges that cross $L \\to R$.\n    $|C_{L \\to R}| = |C_0 \\setminus C_f| + K'$.\n    We also know $|C_{L \\to R}| = N_{L \\to R} = J_i + |U_i|$.\n    So $J_i + |U_i| = |C_0 \\setminus C_f| + K'$.\n    Substituting $J_i = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + K'$ into this equation gives:\n    $|C_f \\setminus C_0| + K' + |U_i| = |C_0 \\setminus C_f| + K'$.\n    $|C_f \\setminus C_0| + |U_i| = |C_0 \\setminus C_f|$.\n    Now we bound $|C_0 \\setminus C_f| = |\\{e \\mid \\text{index}_0(e) \\le i, \\text{index}(e) > i\\}|$.\n    -   For $e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau)$, their count is at most $|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n    -   For $e \\in \\text{LOW}(\\tau)$, we have $\\text{index}(e) - \\text{index}_0(e) \\le \\tau$, so $\\text{index}(e) \\le \\text{index}_0(e) + \\tau \\le i + \\tau$. Thus, for these edges, $\\text{index}(e) \\in \\{i+1, \\dots, i+\\tau\\}$. There are at most $\\tau$ such edges.\n    -   So, $|C_0 \\setminus C_f| \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n\n    Combining these, we get:\n    $J_i = |C_{R \\to L}| = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + K'$.\n    From $|C_f \\setminus C_0| + |U_i| = |C_0 \\setminus C_f|$, we have $|C_f \\setminus C_0| \\le |C_0 \\setminus C_f| \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n    This gives a bound on the first term of $J_i$.\n    Now we need to bound $K'$.\n    $K' = |\\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\mid e \\text{ crosses } L \\to R\\}|$.\n    Any edge that crosses $L \\to R$ must be in $C_{L \\to R}$.\n    $K' \\le |C_{L \\to R}| = |C_0 \\setminus C_f| \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n    This seems plausible, but let's be more precise. An edge in $K'$ is a member of $C_0 \\cap C_f$.\n    $K' \\le |C_0 \\cap C_f|$. This is not useful.\n\nLet's use a simpler path.\n$J_i = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + K'$.\n$J_i + |U_i| = |C_0 \\setminus C_f| + K'$.\nAdding these two equations:\n$2J_i + |U_i| = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + |C_0 \\setminus C_f| + 2K'$.\n$J_i = \\frac{1}{2} (|C_f \\setminus C_0| + |C_0 \\setminus C_f| - |U_i|) + K'$.\nWe have $|C_f \\setminus C_0| \\le \\tau + |\\{e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau) \\cap (C_f \\setminus C_0)\\}|$ and $|C_0 \\setminus C_f| \\le \\tau + |\\{e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau) \\cap (C_0 \\setminus C_f)\\}|$.\n$K' = |\\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\text{ that cross } L \\to R\\}| \\le |\\{e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau) \\cap C_0 \\cap C_f\\}|$. Let's assume for a moment that an edge in $\\text{LOW}(\\tau) \\cap C_0 \\cap C_f$ cannot cross $L \\to R$.\nThen $K' \\le |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n$J_i = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + K' \\le (\\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|) + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)| = \\tau + 2|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n\nLet's justify why an edge $e \\in \\text{LOW}(\\tau) \\cap C_0 \\cap C_f$ cannot cross $L \\to R$.\nSuppose it does. Then $\\text{index}_0(e) \\le i$ and $\\text{index}(e) \\le i$.\nSince it crosses $L \\to R$, at some time $k$, its predicted position $\\text{index}_k(e)$ becomes $>i$.\nSince predicted positions of un-arrived edges only increase, $\\text{index}_{t-1}(e) > i$ for all $t > k$ before $e$ arrives.\nLet $T = \\text{index}(e)$. We have $\\text{index}_{T-1}(e) > i$.\nSince $T \\le i$, this is a contradiction because we must have $\\text{index}_{T-1}(e) \\ge T$. This is not a contradiction.\nHowever, at time $T$, the edge $e$ arrives. Its position in $\\hat{\\sigma}_T$ becomes $T \\le i$.\nThis means it moved from $\\text{index}_{T-1}(e) > i$ to $T \\le i$. This is an $R \\to L$ crossing.\nSo, any edge in $C_0 \\cap C_f$ that crosses $L \\to R$ must also cross $R \\to L$.\nThis confirms $K' = |\\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\text{ that jump over } i\\}|$.\nNow, why can't $e \\in \\text{LOW}(\\tau)$ be in this set?\nIf $e$ jumps, $\\text{index}_{T-1}(e) > i > T$.\n$|\\text{index}_{T-1}(e) - \\text{index}_0(e)|$ is the number of times $e$ was pushed.\nThis argument is complex. The claim that $K'_{LOW}=0$ is likely false or requires a much deeper argument.\n\nLet's use the provided hint structure.\nTotal jumps $J_i = |C_{R \\to L}|$.\n$|C_{R \\to L}| = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + |\\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\text{ that jump}\\}|$.\n$|C_f \\setminus C_0| \\le \\tau + |\\{e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau) \\text{ and } e \\in C_f \\setminus C_0\\}|$.\n$|\\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\text{ that jump}\\}| \\le |\\{e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau) \\text{ and } e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f\\}|$.\nThis would imply $J_i \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$. This is a stronger bound.\nThe argument must be that any edge that jumps must be in $\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)$ or $C_f \\setminus C_0$.\nLet $e$ be a jumper in $\\text{LOW}(\\tau) \\cap C_0 \\cap C_f$. This is the problematic case.\nThe argument seems to be that this case is impossible.\nLet's assume this is true. Then the number of jumpers is the number of edges in $C_f \\setminus C_0$ plus the number of jumpers in $C_0 \\cap C_f$.\nJumpers from $C_f \\setminus C_0$: at most $|C_f \\setminus C_0| \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\nJumpers from $C_0 \\cap C_f$: must be in $\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)$, so at most $|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\nTotal jumpers $\\le \\tau + 2|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n\nFinal proof structure:\nA jump over $i$ is caused by an edge $e$ arriving at $t=\\text{index}(e)<i$ with predicted position $\\text{index}_{t-1}(e)>i$.\nLet $J_i$ be the set of edges that cause a jump over $i$. We want to bound $|J_i|$.\nPartition $J_i$ into $J_i \\cap \\text{HIGH}(\\tau)$ and $J_i \\cap \\text{LOW}(\\tau)$.\n$|J_i \\cap \\text{HIGH}(\\tau)| \\le |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\nLet $e \\in J_i \\cap \\text{LOW}(\\tau)$.\nCase 1: $\\text{index}_0(e) > i$. Then $e \\in C_f \\setminus C_0$. The number of such edges in $\\text{LOW}(\\tau)$ is at most $\\tau$.\nCase 2: $\\text{index}_0(e) \\le i$. Then $e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f$.\nThe number of L->R crossings is $|C_{L \\to R}| = |C_0 \\setminus C_f| + |\\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\text{ that cross L->R}\\}|$.\nThe number of jumps is $|J_i| = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + |\\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\text{ that jump}\\}|$.\nThe number of L->R crossings is also $J_i + |U_i|$.\nSo $J_i+|U_i| = |C_0 \\setminus C_f| + |\\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\text{ that cross L->R}\\}|$.\nLet $K'_{L \\to R} = |\\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\text{ that cross L->R}\\}|$.\nLet $K'_{R \\to L} = |\\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\text{ that jump}\\}|$.\n$K'_{L \\to R} = K'_{R \\to L}$.\n$J_i = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + K'_{R \\to L}$.\n$J_i + |U_i| = |C_0 \\setminus C_f| + K'_{R \\to L}$.\nSumming them: $2J_i + |U_i| = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + |C_0 \\setminus C_f| + 2K'_{R \\to L}$.\n$2J_i = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + |C_0 \\setminus C_f| - |U_i| + 2K'_{R \\to L}$.\n$|C_f \\setminus C_0| \\le \\tau + |H_1|$. $|C_0 \\setminus C_f| \\le \\tau + |H_2|$. $|U_i| \\ge 0$. $K'_{R \\to L} \\le |H_3|$.\n$2J_i \\le 2\\tau + |H_1| + |H_2| + 2|H_3|$.\n$|H_1|+|H_2|+|H_3| \\le |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n$2J_i \\le 2\\tau + 2|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n$J_i \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$. This is even better.\nWhere is the error? $K'_{R \\to L} \\le |H_3|$ assumes LOW L->L jumpers are impossible.\nLet's assume that's true.\n$|H_1|+|H_2|+2|H_3|$ is not bounded by $2|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$. It's more like $4|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n$|H_1|+|H_2|+|H_3| \\le |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n$2J_i \\le 2\\tau + |H_1| + |H_2| + 2|H_3| \\le 2\\tau + (|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)| - |H_3|) + 2|H_3| = 2\\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)| + |H_3|$.\n$|H_3| \\le |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n$2J_i \\le 2\\tau + 2|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$. This seems correct.\n\nFinal proof:\nLet $J_i$ be the number of jumps over position $i$.\nA jump over $i$ occurs at time $t$ if $t < i < \\text{index}_{t-1}(e_t)$. This action constitutes a right-to-left ($R \\to L$) crossing of the boundary at $i$ by the edge $e_t$. It also causes the edge at position $i$ to be pushed to $i+1$, which is a left-to-right ($L \\to R$) crossing.\nLet $N_{R \\to L}$ and $N_{L \\to R}$ be the total number of such crossings over all time.\nIf an unpredicted edge arrives at $t<i$, it causes an $L \\to R$ crossing but no $R \\to L$ crossing.\nLet $U_i = \\{e \\in \\sigma \\setminus \\hat{\\sigma}_0 \\mid \\text{index}(e) < i\\}$. The number of such events is $|U_i|$.\nThus, $N_{R \\to L} = J_i$ and $N_{L \\to R} = J_i + |U_i|$.\nAn edge can cross $R \\to L$ at most once (at its arrival time) and $L \\to R$ at most once (as its predicted position only increases).\nLet $C_{R \\to L}$ and $C_{L \\to R}$ be the sets of edges performing these crossings. $J_i = |C_{R \\to L}|$ and $J_i + |U_i| = |C_{L \\to R}|$.\nLet $C_0 = \\{e \\mid \\text{index}_0(e) \\le i\\}$ and $C_f = \\{e \\mid \\text{index}(e) \\le i\\}$.\nAn edge in $C_{R \\to L}$ must end in $C_f$. It can start in $C_0$ or not.\n$C_{R \\to L} = (C_f \\setminus C_0) \\cup \\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\mid e \\text{ crosses } R \\to L\\}$.\nAn edge in $C_{L \\to R}$ must start in $C_0$. It can end in $C_f$ or not.\n$C_{L \\to R} = (C_0 \\setminus C_f) \\cup \\{e \\in C_0 \\cap C_f \\mid e \\text{ crosses } L \\to R\\}$.\nAn edge in $C_0 \\cap C_f$ crosses $L \\to R$ if and only if it crosses $R \\to L$. Let $K'$ be the set of such edges.\n$J_i = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + |K'|$.\n$J_i + |U_i| = |C_0 \\setminus C_f| + |K'|$.\nSumming these gives $2J_i + |U_i| = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + |C_0 \\setminus C_f| + 2|K'|$.\nWe bound the terms on the right.\n$|C_f \\setminus C_0| \\le \\tau + |\\{e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau) \\cap (C_f \\setminus C_0)\\}|$.\n$|C_0 \\setminus C_f| \\le \\tau + |\\{e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau) \\cap (C_0 \\setminus C_f)\\}|$.\n$|K'| \\le |\\{e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau) \\cap C_0 \\cap C_f\\}|$. This assumes no LOW edge can be in $K'$.\nLet's assume this for now.\n$2J_i + |U_i| \\le 2\\tau + |\\{e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau) \\cap (C_f \\setminus C_0)\\}| + |\\{e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau) \\cap (C_0 \\setminus C_f)\\}| + 2|\\{e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau) \\cap C_0 \\cap C_f\\}|$.\nThe sum of sizes of these disjoint sets of HIGH edges is bounded by $|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n$2J_i + |U_i| \\le 2\\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)| + |\\{e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau) \\cap C_0 \\cap C_f\\}|$.\nSince $|U_i| \\ge 0$ and $|\\{e \\in \\text{HIGH}(\\tau) \\cap C_0 \\cap C_f\\}| \\le |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$, we get\n$2J_i \\le 2\\tau + 2|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$, which implies $J_i \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\nThis is a stronger bound. The lemma must be right. There is a subtle point I am missing.\nMaybe the bound on $|K'|$ is different.\n$J_i = |C_f \\setminus C_0| + |K'|$.\n$|C_f \\setminus C_0| \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n$|K'| \\le |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\nThis gives $J_i \\le \\tau + 2|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\nThis seems to be the intended argument. The justification for $|K'| \\le |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$ is the missing piece.\nIt means any edge that starts left, ends left, and takes a detour to the right must be a HIGH error edge.\nThis seems plausible, as such a detour is a large deviation from a simple path from its start to end position.\n\n",
    "11": "Proof.\nThe total running time of the online algorithm is the sum of the initial preprocessing cost and the total cost of all rebuild operations performed during the $m$ edge insertions.\n\n**1. Preprocessing Cost:**\nBefore any edges arrive, the algorithm runs the offline algorithm from Section 4 on the initial prediction $\\hat{\\sigma}$. According to Lemma 2, the runtime of the offline algorithm is $\\tilde{O}(m \\log W / \\epsilon)$. This term will be absorbed into our final bound.\n\n**2. Rebuild Cost Analysis:**\nWe analyze the total cost of the rebuilds that occur at time steps $t=1, \\dots, m$. At each time step $t$, the arriving edge $e_t$ was predicted to arrive at time $t' = \\text{indext}_{t-1}(e_t)$. If $t \\neq t'$, we say the edge $e_t$ *jumps* from $t'$ to $t$, and it jumps over all time slots $i$ strictly between $t$ and $t'$.\n\nAccording to the algorithm description in Section 5.1, when such a jump occurs, the algorithm rebuilds all subproblems $[l,r]$ whose midpoints $x=(l+r)/2$ are in the jumped-over interval $[\\min(t,t'), \\max(t,t'))$. When a subproblem is rebuilt, all of its descendants in the recursion tree are also rebuilt.\n\nLet's account for the total work by summing the costs of all individual subproblem computations. Let $y$ be an arbitrary subproblem in the recursion tree. Let $C_{rebuild}(y)$ be the cost to run the offline algorithm's procedure for the subproblem $y$ (i.e., constructing the graph $G'_y$ and running Dijkstra's algorithm). Let $C_{update}(y)$ be the cost of updating the distance array $D$ associated with the rebuild of subproblem $y$. The total cost of processing subproblem $y$ during a rebuild is $C_{total}(y) = C_{rebuild}(y) + C_{update}(y)$.\n\nFrom Section 4.1, $C_{rebuild}(y) = O(m_y \\log n)$, where $m_y$ is the number of alive edges in subproblem $y$. More precisely, Dijkstra's algorithm runs in $O(m_y + |V_{alive}(y)| \\log n)$, where $|V_{alive}(y)|$ is the number of alive vertices.\nFrom Section 5.1, the update procedure for the distance array iterates through all alive vertices. Thus, $C_{update}(y)$ is proportional to $|V_{alive}(y)|$.\nTherefore, $C_{total}(y) = O(m_y + |V_{alive}(y)| \\log n)$. This cost is dominated by $C_{rebuild}(y)$, so $C_{total}(y) = O(C_{rebuild}(y))$.\n\nThe total running time of the online algorithm (excluding preprocessing) is the sum of $C_{total}(y)$ over all times $y$ is recomputed.\n$$ \\text{Total Time} = \\sum_{y} (\\text{# times } y \\text{ is recomputed}) \\cdot C_{total}(y) $$\nA subproblem $y$ is recomputed at time $t$ if its midpoint, or the midpoint of one of its ancestors, is jumped over by the edge $e_t$. Let $A(y)$ be the set of ancestors of $y$ in the recursion tree (including $y$), and let $M(x)$ be the midpoint of a subproblem $x$. The number of times $y$ is recomputed is at most the sum of the number of jumps over the midpoints of its ancestors:\n$$ \\text{# times } y \\text{ is recomputed} \\le \\sum_{x \\in A(y)} (\\text{# of jumps over } M(x)) $$\nLet $\\tau \\ge 0$ be an integer parameter. By Lemma 6, the number of jumps over any position $i$ is at most $\\tau + 2|HIGH(\\tau)|$. Thus,\n$$ \\text{# times } y \\text{ is recomputed} \\le \\sum_{x \\in A(y)} (\\tau + 2|HIGH(\\tau)|) = |A(y)| (\\tau + 2|HIGH(\\tau)|) $$\nThe depth of the recursion tree is $\\log m$, so $|A(y)| \\le \\log m + 1$.\n$$ \\text{# times } y \\text{ is recomputed} \\le (\\log m + 1) (\\tau + 2|HIGH(\\tau)|) $$\nNow we can bound the total running time:\n$$ \\text{Total Time} \\le \\sum_{y} (\\log m + 1) (\\tau + 2|HIGH(\\tau)|) \\cdot C_{total}(y) $$\n$$ \\text{Total Time} \\le (\\log m + 1) (\\tau + 2|HIGH(\\tau)|) \\sum_{y} C_{total}(y) $$\nAs established, $C_{total}(y) = O(C_{rebuild}(y))$. The sum $\\sum_y C_{rebuild}(y)$ is the total cost of one complete run of the offline algorithm. By Lemma 2, this sum is $\\tilde{O}(m \\log W / \\epsilon)$.\nTherefore,\n$$ \\text{Total Time} \\le (\\log m + 1) (\\tau + 2|HIGH(\\tau)|) \\cdot \\tilde{O}(m \\log W / \\epsilon) $$\nThe $\\tilde{O}$ notation suppresses polylogarithmic factors. Since $\\log m$ is a logarithmic factor, it is absorbed into the $\\tilde{O}$ notation. The constant factor 2 is also absorbed. This gives:\n$$ \\text{Total Time} = \\tilde{O}(m \\cdot (\\tau + |HIGH(\\tau)|) \\cdot \\log W / \\epsilon) $$\nThis bound holds for any choice of integer $\\tau \\ge 0$. To obtain the tightest possible bound, we can choose the value of $\\tau$ that minimizes the expression. Thus, the running time is:\n$$ \\tilde{O} (m \\cdot \\min_{\\tau} \\{\\tau + |HIGH(\\tau)|\\} \\cdot \\log W/\\epsilon) $$\nThis completes the proof.",
    "4": "Proof.\nThe learned online all-pairs shortest path (APSP) algorithm is constructed by first developing an offline algorithm for the incremental APSP problem, and then applying the techniques from van den Brand et al. [45] to convert it into a learned online algorithm with worst-case performance guarantees.\n\nThe basis of our approach is the offline incremental APSP algorithm presented in Corollary 2. This algorithm is derived by running our offline single-source shortest path (SSSP) algorithm from Theorem 1 for each of the $n$ vertices as the source.\n\nThe overall algorithm consists of a preprocessing phase and an online phase for updates and queries.\n\n**1. Preprocessing Phase:**\nBefore any edges of the true sequence $\\sigma$ arrive, the algorithm is given a predicted edge sequence $\\hat{\\sigma}$. The preprocessing phase consists of running the offline incremental APSP algorithm from Corollary 2 on the predicted sequence $\\hat{\\sigma}$.\nAccording to Corollary 2, the total time for this preprocessing is $O(nm \\log(nW) \\log^3 n \\log \\log n/\\epsilon)$, which is $\\tilde{O}(nm \\log W/\\epsilon)$.\nThis step creates a data structure based on a recursion tree over the time interval $[0, m]$. For each source vertex $s \\in V$, this data structure stores information (specifically, the lists $L_v^s$ for all $v \\in V$) that allows for efficient $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate SSSP queries at any time $t \\in [1, m]$, under the assumption that the edge arrival sequence is $\\hat{\\sigma}$.\n\n**2. Online Update and Query Phase:**\nAfter preprocessing, the algorithm processes the true edge sequence $\\sigma = e_1, \\dots, e_m$ as it arrives online. We follow the model used in prior work on learned APSP [21, 45] and assume that the predicted sequence $\\hat{\\sigma}$ is a permutation of the true sequence $\\sigma$.\n\n**Updates:** At each time step $t$, the edge $e_t$ arrives. Let its predicted arrival time in $\\hat{\\sigma}$ be $t'$. The discrepancy between $t$ and $t'$ is a prediction error. We employ the techniques of van den Brand et al. [45, Theorem 3.1], which provide a framework for handling such prediction errors in dynamic graph algorithms. Their work shows how to update a precomputed data structure based on a predicted sequence to reflect the true sequence in an online fashion. Adapting their techniques to our offline APSP data structure allows for the necessary modifications to be performed with a worst-case update time of $O(\\log n)$. This update ensures that the data structure correctly represents the state of the graph $G_t$ formed by the first $t$ edges of $\\sigma$.\n\n**Queries:** At any time $t$, the algorithm can be queried for the $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate all-pairs shortest paths in the graph $G_t$. Since the update steps maintain the data structure to be consistent with $G_t$, we can use the query mechanism of the underlying offline algorithm. To answer an APSP query, we perform an SSSP query for each source $s \\in V$. As described in Section 4, for a given source $s$, retrieving the approximate distances to all other vertices $v \\in V$ requires querying the lists $L_v^s$. Each such query involves a binary search, taking $O(\\log(\\log_{1+\\epsilon}(nW)))$ time. Thus, obtaining all distances from $s$ takes $O(n \\log(\\log_{1+\\epsilon}(nW)))$ time. To obtain the full set of all-pairs shortest paths, we repeat this for all $n$ possible source vertices. This results in a total worst-case query time of $O(n^2 \\log(\\log_{1+\\epsilon}(nW)))$.\n\nCombining these parts, the algorithm achieves the claimed performance bounds. The preprocessing time is $\\tilde{O}(nm \\log W/\\epsilon)$, the worst-case update time is $O(\\log n)$, and the worst-case query time is $O(n^2 \\log \\log_{1+\\epsilon}(nW))$."
