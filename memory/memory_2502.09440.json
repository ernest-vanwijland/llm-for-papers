    "Proof. We will use a probabilistic argument.\nFirstly, if $d \\le 16\\ln(n)$, then we let $H$ be the empty graph. Since $\\Delta(G) \\le \\Delta$, the largest clique in $G$ has size $\\le \\Delta$. Indeed, $16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{d} + 10 \\ge 16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{16\\ln(n)} = \\Delta$.\nSimilarly, if $\\Delta \\le d$, then take $H = G$. The largest clique size is 1 and $\\Delta(H) \\le \\Delta \\le d$. Finally, if $n \\le 10$, then the largest clique size is at most 10, so we can let $S$ be the empty graph as well.\nIt remains to prove the lemma for $n > 10$ and $16 \\ln(n) < d < \\Delta$. We choose $S$ by sampling each edge in $G$ with probability $d/(2\\Delta)$. For any vertex $v$, we let $X_1, \\dots, X_{\\deg(v)}$ be indicator variables for whether an incident edge is chosen. If we let $X := \\sum_{i=1}^{\\deg(v)} X_i$, then $E[X] \\le d/2$. By Proposition 2.2 with $\\epsilon = 1$,\n$$ \\Pr(X > d) \\le \\Pr(X > 2 \\cdot E[X]) \\le \\exp(-\\frac{d}{4}) < \\exp(-\\frac{16\\ln n}{8}) = \\exp(-2\\ln n). $$\nHence, by a union bound, Pr(Some vertex in $H$ has degree greater than $d$) does not exceed\n$$ n \\cdot \\exp(-2\\ln n) = \\exp(\\ln n - 2\\ln n) = \\exp(-\\ln n) = \\frac{1}{n}. $$\nFor any group of $16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{d} + 10 \\le k$ vertices, if it is not a clique in $G$, it definitely will not be a clique after removing the edges in $H$. Otherwise, it can only be a clique if none of the edges are selected. For any $k$-subset, the probability of this happening is:\n$$ \\Pr(\\text{this k-subset is a clique}) = \\left(1 - \\frac{d}{2\\Delta}\\right)^{k(k-1)/2} $$\n$$ < \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{2\\Delta} \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ < \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{2\\Delta} \\left(16\\ln n \\frac{\\Delta}{d}\\right) \\frac{k-1}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ = \\exp(-4\\ln n \\cdot (k-1)). $$\nNow, we apply a union bound over all $k$-subsets of vertices:\n$$ \\Pr(G-H \\text{ has a k-clique}) < \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot \\exp(-4\\ln n \\cdot (k-1)) $$\n$$ < \\left(\\frac{en}{k}\\right)^k \\cdot \\exp(-4\\ln n \\cdot (k-1)) $$\n$$ = \\exp(k\\ln(en/k) - 4\\ln(n) \\cdot (k-1)) $$\n$$ = \\exp(k(1 + \\ln(n) - \\ln(k) - 4\\ln(n)) + 4\\ln n) $$\n$$ < \\exp(k(1 - 3\\ln(n)) + 4\\ln(n)) $$\n$$ < \\exp(-2k\\ln n + 4\\ln(n)) \\quad (\\text{Since } \\ln(n) \\ge 1) $$\n$$ < \\exp(-6\\ln(n) + 4\\ln(n)) \\quad (\\text{Sub } k = 16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{d} \\ge 3) $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{n^2}. $$\nFinally, we calculate the probability that this procedure yields a subgraph $H$ satisfying Item 1 and Item 2. Through a union bound on the complement, when $n > 10$, we get\n$$ \\Pr(H \\text{ does not satisfy Item 1 or Item 2}) \\le \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{100} < 1. $$\nThus, there is some $H$ satisfying the two conditions.",
    "Proof. Let $P := \\{v \\in V : \\text{deg}(v) \\le b\\}$. Then, $Q := V \\setminus P$. This is clearly a partition, since each vertex is in exactly one of P or Q.\n\nWe will now prove the bound on $G[P]$. For every vertex $v \\in P$, $\\text{deg}(v) \\le b$ in $G$. Since $G[P]$ is a subgraph of $G$, $\\text{deg}(v) \\le b$ in $G[P]$ as well. Hence, $\\Delta(G[P]) \\le b$.\n\nNow for the bound on $|Q|$. It is known that the number of edges is equal to half the sum of the degrees. Hence, we have\n$$ m = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in V} \\text{deg}(v) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in V \\setminus P} \\text{deg}(v) > \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in Q} b = \\frac{1}{2} |Q| \\cdot b. $$\nThen, we rearrange to get $|Q| < \\frac{2m}{b}$.",
    "Proof. Let $\\mathcal{H} := \\text{PARTITION}(G_{Base}, g)$ and $H_{Base} := \\cup_{S \\in \\mathcal{H}} G_{Base}[S]$. We prove this lemma through casework on $d_{comp}$.\n\nIf $d_{comp} < g$, then we define $\\mathcal{H} := \\mathcal{G}(H_{Base}, \\frac{d_{comp}}{g}, g)$.\nFor all $H \\in \\text{supp}(\\mathcal{H})$, $\\Delta(H) \\le 2 \\cdot \\frac{d_{comp}}{g} \\cdot g = 2 \\cdot d_{comp}$ by construction, proving Item 1.\nThese values of $p = \\frac{d_{comp}}{g}$ and $d = g$ satisfy the requirements for the Compression Lemma. In particular, since $4\\ln(2n) \\le d_{comp} < g$, we have $p = \\frac{d_{comp}}{g} \\in (0,1)$. Additionally, $d = g > \\Delta(H_{Base})$ since each subgraph has at most $g$ vertices, and $d = g = \\frac{d_{comp}}{d_{comp}/g} > \\frac{4\\ln(2n)}{p}$. Hence, the values of $p$ and $d$ satisfy the necessary constraints.\nTherefore, there exists some message $\\phi$ such that $H_{Miss}(\\phi) = (V, E_{Miss}(\\phi))$ satisfies\n$$|E_{Miss}(\\phi)| < \\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1) \\cdot g}{d_{comp}}$$\nLet $(L, Q) := \\text{SPLIT}(H_{Miss}(\\phi), d_{filter})$. By Proposition 3.3, $|Q| \\le \\frac{2|E_{Miss}(\\phi)|}{d_{filter}} \\le \\frac{2\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1)g}{d_{comp} \\cdot d_{filter}}$, proving Item 5.\nAdditionally, let $\\mathcal{P} := \\{S \\cap L : S \\in \\mathcal{H}\\}$. Since $\\mathcal{H}$ is a partition of $V$ and $Q = V\\setminus L$, we know that $\\mathcal{P} \\cup \\{Q\\}$ is a partition of $V$. By Fact 2.1, $|\\mathcal{P}| = |\\mathcal{H}| \\le \\lceil \\frac{n}{g} \\rceil$, proving Item 4.\nWe will now prove the conditions on all $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$. Let $X_P := H_{Miss}(\\phi)[P]$.\n- By Proposition 3.3, since $P \\subseteq L$, $\\Delta(X_P) \\le \\Delta(H_{Miss}(\\phi)[L]) \\le d_{filter}$. This proves Item 3.\n- We know $P \\subseteq S$ for some $S \\in \\mathcal{H}$. Additionally, $\\mathcal{H}$ is a partition of $V$. So, by our construction of $H_{Base}$, we have $H_{Base}[S] = G_{Base}[S]$. Hence, since $P \\subseteq S$, we have $H_{Base}[P] = G_{Base}[P]$. This proves Item 2.\n\nIf $d_{comp} \\ge g$, then we let $\\mathcal{H} = \\mathcal{G}(H_{Base}, 1, |V|)$. We let $\\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{H}$, so $Q = \\emptyset$, which satisfies Item 5. The distribution $\\mathcal{H}$ is a single graph $H_{Base}$. Since each subgraph in $H_{Base}$ has $\\le g$ vertices, $\\Delta(H_{Base}) \\le g \\le 2 \\cdot d_{comp}$, proving Item 1. Since $|\\mathcal{P}| = |\\mathcal{H}|$, Item 4 is proven by Fact 2.1. Since $\\text{supp}(\\mathcal{H}) = \\{H_{Base}\\}$, $H_{Miss}(\\phi) = \\emptyset$, proving Item 3. By how we defined $\\mathcal{P}$ and $H_{Base}$ (note that $\\mathcal{H}$ is a partition), $G_{Base}[P] = H_{Base}[P]$ for all $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$. This proves Item 2.",
    "Proof. For all $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, by Lemma 3.1 on $H[P]$ and $d_{\\text{remove}}$, there is a graph $R_P$ with degree $\\leq d_{\\text{remove}}$ s.t. the maximum clique size in $H[P] - R_P$ is $\\leq 16 \\ln(n) \\frac{d_{\\text{filter}}}{d_{\\text{remove}}} + 10$.\nWe take $R := \\cup_{P \\in \\mathcal{P}} R_P$. Since $Q$ is disjoint with all sets in $\\mathcal{P}$, none of the edges in $R$ are incident to any vertex in $Q$. Additionally, for all $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, since $R_P \\subseteq R$ and the vertex sets in $\\mathcal{P}$ are disjoint, we have $R_P = R[P]$. Thus, the largest clique in $(H - R)[P] = H[P] - R_P$ has size $\\leq 16 \\ln(n) \\frac{d_{\\text{filter}}}{d_{\\text{remove}}} + 10$.",
    "Proof. It is sufficient to prove the stronger statement that $\\{H_i : i \\in [k]\\} \\cup \\{R_{i+1} : i \\in [k]\\}$ is disjoint. For each $i \\in [k]$, by Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5, $H_{\\text{Base}}(i) \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$ and $R_{i+1} \\subseteq H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i) \\subseteq H_{\\text{Base}}(i) \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$. Hence, both $H_i$ and $R_{i+1}$ are subgraphs of $G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$.\n\nFirstly, we claim that $H_i$ and $R_{i+1}$ are edge-disjoint. In particular, since $H_i$ is sampled from $\\text{supp}(\\mathcal{H}_i)$ and $\\Phi_i(H_i) = M_i$, by definition, we know that none of the edges in $H_i$ are in $H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)$. However, $R_{i+1} \\subseteq H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)$, so none of the edges in $R_{i+1}$ are in $H_i$.\n\nNext, we prove that $G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$ is edge-disjoint with $H_i$ and $R_{i+1}$. For any edge in $H_i$, it is in $H_{\\text{Base}}(i)$ but not $H_{\\text{Miss}}(i)$. Hence, it is not in $G_{\\text{Base}}(i) - (H_{\\text{Base}}(i) - H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i))$. For $R_{i+1}$, by Lemma 3.5, none of its edges are incident to a vertex in $Q_i$. Thus, none of the edges in $R_{i+1}$ appear in $G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1) = (G_{\\text{Base}}(i) - (H_{\\text{Base}}(i) - H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)))[Q_i]$.\n\nFinally, for any $j > i$, we know that $G_{\\text{Base}}(j) \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$. Thus, for any edge $(u,v)$ in $H_i$ or $R_{i+1}$, we know that $(u,v)$ is not in $G_{\\text{Base}}(j)$ (since $(u,v) \\notin G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$). Since $H_j$ and $R_{j+1}$ are subgraphs of $G_{\\text{Base}}(j)$, $(u,v)$ will not be in $H_j$ or $R_{j+1}$ either.\n\nThus, an edge in $H_i$ or $R_{i+1}$ (it only appears in one of the two) will not be sent in any $H_j$ or $R_{j+1}$ if $j > i$. As such, $\\{H_i : i \\in [k]\\} \\cup \\{R_{i+1} : i \\in [k]\\}$ is edge-disjoint. Since $R_1$ is empty, this set contains all the graphs sent to any player. Hence, no two players will receive the same edge.",
    "Proof. We consider the degree on each vertex $v$. Firstly, there is at most one value of $i$ for which $v$ is incident to some edge in $R_i$. After all, by Lemma 3.5, if an edge in $R_i$ is incident to $v$, then $v \\notin Q_{i-1}$ and $v$ is not in $G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$ nor any subsequent graphs. For this value of $i$, $\\Delta(R_i) \\le \\frac{\\Delta}{l}$. Furthermore, $\\Delta(H_j) \\le \\frac{2\\Delta}{l}$ for all $j \\in [k]$ by Lemma 3.4. Thus, $\\text{deg}(v)$ cannot exceed $\\frac{\\Delta}{l}$ in $R_i$ nor $\\frac{2\\Delta}{l}$ in $H_j$ for any $j \\in [k]$.\nSince $G_{\\text{input}} = (\\cup_{i=1}^k H_i) \\cup (\\cup_{i=1}^k R_i)$, the degree of $v$ in $G_{\\text{input}}$ is the sum of its degree in each of these graphs. In particular, the degree of $v$ is $\\le k \\cdot \\frac{2\\Delta}{l} + \\frac{\\Delta}{l} \\le \\frac{4 \\ln(n) \\cdot \\Delta}{l} + \\frac{\\Delta}{l} < \\frac{\\Delta}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta}{2} = \\Delta$. The second last inequality is true by $k = [\\ln(n)] + 1$ and $n > \\eta$. The last is true by $l \\ge 8 \\ln n$.",
    "Proof. We begin by proving that $n_i \\le \\max(\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}, \\frac{n}{l^{i-1}})$, which we will show through induction.\nFor the base case, $n_1 = n \\le \\frac{n}{l^0}$.\nFor the inductive step, if $n_i < \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$, then $n_{i+1} < \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$ too. Otherwise, by Lemma 3.4,\n$$|Q_i| < \\frac{2\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1) \\cdot \\lceil n_i \\Delta^2 / n \\rceil}{\\frac{\\Delta}{l} \\cdot l^2 \\Delta}$$\nDropping the floor, the above is $\\le \\frac{2\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1) \\cdot n_i \\Delta^2}{nl^2} = \\frac{2\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1)}{nl} \\cdot n_i \\le \\frac{1}{l} \\cdot n_i = \\frac{n_i}{l}$.\nThe second last inequality is true by the bound on $l$, while the last is true by the inductive hypothesis. Note that $n_{i+1} = |Q_i|$. This concludes the inductive step.\n\nTo prove Lemma 4.3, we note that $\\frac{n}{l^{k-1}} < \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$. Since $\\Delta < \\sqrt{n}$, we have $\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2} > 1 > \\frac{e^2}{l^{k-1}}$, so $\\max(\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}, \\frac{n}{l^{i-1}}) = \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$. We showed that $n_k \\le \\max(\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}, \\frac{n}{l^{k-1}})$, so $n_k \\le \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$.",
    "Proof. By Lemma 3.4, $|P_i| \\le \\lceil \\frac{n_i}{\\lceil n_i \\Delta^2 / n \\rceil} \\rceil \\le \\frac{n_i}{n_i \\Delta^2 / n} + 1 \\le \\frac{2n}{\\Delta^2} + 1 \\le \\frac{3n}{\\Delta^2}$.\nThe second inequality is true because $\\frac{n_i \\Delta^2}{n} \\ge 1$. The last inequality is true by $\\Delta < \\sqrt{n}$.",
    "Proof. For each $v \\in A$, either $v \\in G_{Base}(k + 1)$ or $v \\in P$ for some $i \\in [k]$ and $P \\in \\mathcal{P}_i$. We let $L_i := \\cup_{P \\in \\mathcal{P}_i} P$. Since $n_k < \\frac{3n}{\\Delta^2}$, more than $\\frac{n(96\\ell^2 \\ln(n)+30)}{\\Delta^2}$ vertices in $A$ are also in $L_1 \\cup \\dots \\cup L_k$. By the Pigeonhole principle, for some $i \\in [k]$, we have $|L_i \\cap A| > \\frac{n(96\\ell^2 \\ln(n)+30)}{\\Delta^2}$. Since $\\mathcal{P}_i$ is a partition of the vertices in $L_i$, and since $|\\mathcal{P}_i| \\le \\frac{3n}{\\Delta^2}$ by Lemma 4.4, there is some $P = (V_P, E_P) \\in \\mathcal{P}_i$ such that $|P \\cap A| > 32\\ell^2 \\ln(n) + 10$ (again, by the Pigeonhole principle).\n\nBy Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5, the largest clique in $(H_{Miss}(M_i) - R_{i+1})[P]$ has size at most\n$$16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{d_{filter}}{d_{removal}} + 10 = 16 \\cdot \\frac{\\ell^2\\Delta}{\\Delta/2} \\cdot \\ln(n) + 10 = 32\\ell^2 \\ln(n) + 10.$$\nThus, there is some $u, v \\in P$ such that $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(M_i) - R_{i+1}$.\nIf $(u, v) \\in R_{i+1}$, then we send the same graph and edges. Note that $R_{k+1} = \\emptyset$ since $n_k < \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$. Thus, Player $i+1$ exists and will receive $R_{i+1}$. As such, there is an edge between $(u, v)$ in $G_{input}$.\nOtherwise, we know there is some $j \\in [i]$ s.t. $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(j)$ but $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(M_j)$. We prove this with two cases:\nIf $(u, v) \\in G_{Base}(i)$, then let $j = i$. Since $H_{Base}(i)[P] = G_{Base}(i)[P]$, we have $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(i)$. Additionally, since $(u, v) \\notin R_{i+1}$, we know that $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(M_j)$ as well.\nOtherwise, $(u, v) \\notin G_{Base}(i)$. Since $G_{Base}(i) \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq G_{Base}(1)$ and $(u, v) \\in G_{Base}(1)$, we can find some $j < i$ s.t. $(u, v) \\in G_{Base}(j)$ but $(u, v) \\notin G_{Base}(j+1)$. In particular,\n$$(u, v) \\notin G_{Base}(j+1) = (G_{Base}(j) - (H_{Base}(j) - H_{Miss}(M_j)))[Q_j].$$\nSince $u, v \\in G_{Base}(i)$ and all vertices in $G_{Base}(i)$ are also in $Q_j$, we know that $u, v \\in Q_j$. This allows us to conclude that\n$$(u, v) \\notin G_{Base}(j) - (H_{Base}(j) - H_{Miss}(M_j)).$$\nWe know that $(u, v) \\in G_{Base}(j)$, so we must also have $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(j) - H_{Miss}(M_j)$. Hence, $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(j)$ and $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(M_j)$.\n\nSince $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(j)$, and $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(j)$, there is some graph $H' \\in \\mathcal{H}_j$ such that $(u, v) \\in H'$ and $\\Phi_j(H') = M_j$. We substitute $H_j$ with $H'$ when choosing $G_{input}$ and the edges we send each player. Each player sends the same message, but $(u, v) \\in G'_{input}$, concluding the proof.",
