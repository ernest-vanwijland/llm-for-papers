  "proof": "The proof will be established using a probabilistic method.\n\nFirst, we address a few specific cases. If $d \\le 16 \\ln(n)$, we can select H to be the empty graph. In this situation, the degree of H is 0, which satisfies the first condition. The graph G-H is simply G. The second condition is also met, as the required bound on the clique size is sufficiently large: $16 \\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{d} + 10 \\ge 16 \\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{16 \\ln(n)} = \\Delta$.\n\nSimilarly, if $\\Delta \\le d$, we can choose H to be the entire graph G. The maximum degree of H is at most $\\Delta$, which is less than or equal to d, so the first condition holds. The graph G-H has no edges, meaning its largest clique is of size 1, satisfying the second condition. Lastly, if $n \\le 10$, the largest possible clique size is at most 10, so we can again let H be the empty graph.\n\nIt remains to prove the statement for the case where $n > 10$ and $16 \\ln(n) < d < \\Delta$. We construct H by randomly sampling each edge from G with a probability of $\\frac{d}{2\\Delta}$.\n\nFor any vertex v, we can analyze its degree in H. Let $X_1, \\dots, X_{deg(v)}$ be indicator variables for whether each of the edges incident to v is chosen to be in H. The degree of v in H is the sum $X := \\sum_{i=1}^{deg(v)} X_i$. The expected value of this sum is $\\mathbb{E}[X] \\le \\frac{d}{2}$. By applying Proposition 2.2 with $\\epsilon=1$, we can bound the probability that this degree exceeds d:\n$$ Pr(X > d) \\le Pr(X > 2 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[X]) \\le \\exp(-\\frac{\\frac{d}{2}}{4}) < \\exp(-\\frac{16 \\ln n}{8}) = \\exp(-2 \\ln n). $$\nFrom this, we can use a union bound over all n vertices to find the probability that any vertex in H has a degree greater than d. This probability does not exceed:\n$$ n \\cdot \\exp(-2 \\ln n) = \\exp(\\ln n - 2 \\ln n) = \\exp(-\\ln n) = \\frac{1}{n}. $$\nNext, we analyze the clique size in G-H. Consider any group of k vertices where $k > 16 \\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{d} + 10$. If this group of vertices is not a clique in G, it cannot become a clique in G-H. If it is a clique in G, it will remain a clique in G-H only if none of its edges are selected for H. For any given k-subset that forms a clique in G, the probability of this occurring is:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Pr(this k-subset is a clique)} &= (1-\\frac{d}{2\\Delta})^{k\\cdot(k-1)/2} \\\\\n&\\le \\exp(-\\frac{d}{2\\Delta} \\cdot \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}) \\\\\n&< \\exp(-\\frac{d}{2\\Delta} \\cdot (16 \\ln n \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{d}) \\cdot \\frac{k-1}{2}) \\\\\n&= \\exp(-4 \\ln n \\cdot (k-1)).\n\\end{align*}\nWe can now apply a union bound over all possible k-subsets of vertices to bound the probability that G-H contains a k-clique:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Pr(G-H has a k-clique)} &\\le \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot \\exp(-4 \\ln n \\cdot (k-1)) \\\\\n&\\le (\\frac{en}{k})^k \\cdot \\exp(-4 \\ln n \\cdot (k-1)) \\\\\n&= \\exp(k \\ln(en/k) - 4 \\ln(n) \\cdot (k-1)) \\\\\n&= \\exp(k(1 + \\ln(n) - \\ln(k) - 4 \\ln(n)) + 4 \\ln n) \\\\\n&\\le \\exp(k(1 - 3 \\ln(n)) + 4 \\ln(n)) \\quad (\\text{Since } \\ln(n) \\ge 1) \\\\\n&\\le \\exp(-2k \\ln n + 4 \\ln(n)) \\\\\n&\\le \\exp(-6 \\ln(n) + 4 \\ln(n)) \\quad (\\text{Sub } k=16 \\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{d} \\ge 3) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n^2}\n\\end{align*}\nFinally, we can calculate the probability that this random procedure fails to produce a subgraph H satisfying both conditions. A failure occurs if Item 1 or Item 2 is violated. By applying a union bound on the probabilities of these complementary events, for $n>10$, we find that:\n$$ \\text{Pr(H does not satisfy Item 1 or Item 2)} \\le \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{100} < 1. $$\nSince the probability of failure is strictly less than 1, there must be a non-zero probability of success. Therefore, a subgraph H satisfying the two conditions must exist.",
