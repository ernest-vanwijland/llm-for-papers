  "proof": "For each set $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, we apply Lemma 3.1 to the induced subgraph $H[P]$ and the value $d_{\\text{remove}}$. This application yields a graph $R_P$ with a maximum degree of at most $d_{\\text{remove}}$, for which the maximum clique size in $H[P] - R_P$ is no more than $16 \\ln(n) \\frac{d_{\\text{filter}}}{d_{\\text{remove}}} + 10$.\nWe then define the graph $R$ to be the union of all these $R_P$ graphs, so $R := \\bigcup_{P \\in \\mathcal{P}} R_P$. Since the vertex set $Q$ is disjoint from all sets in $\\mathcal{P}$, none of the edges in $R$ are incident to any vertex in $Q$. Additionally, for any $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, because $R_P$ is a subgraph of $R$ and the vertex sets within $\\mathcal{P}$ are disjoint, the subgraph of $R$ induced by the vertices of $P$ is identical to $R_P$, which means $R_P = R[P]$. Thus, the largest clique in the graph $(H - R)[P] = H[P] - R_P$ has a size of at most $16 \\ln(n) \\frac{d_{\\text{filter}}}{d_{\\text{remove}}} + 10$.",
