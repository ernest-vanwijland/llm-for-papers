  "proof": "We begin by defining $\\mathcal{H} := \\text{PARTITION}(G_{Base}, g)$ and constructing the graph $H_{Base}$ as the union of the subgraphs of $G_{Base}$ induced by the sets in $\\mathcal{H}$, i.e., $H_{Base} := \\bigcup_{S \\in \\mathcal{H}} G_{Base}[S]$. The proof proceeds by considering two cases based on the value of $d_{comp}$.\n\nFirst, consider the case where $d_{comp} < g$. For this scenario, we define the distribution $\\mathcal{H}$ to be $\\mathcal{G}(H_{Base}, \\frac{d_{comp}}{g}, g)$. By the construction of this distribution, for any graph $H$ in its support, the maximum degree is bounded by $\\Delta(H) \\le 2 \\cdot \\frac{d_{comp}}{g} \\cdot g = 2 \\cdot d_{comp}$. This establishes Item 1.\nThe chosen parameters $p = \\frac{d_{comp}}{g}$ and $d = g$ satisfy the preconditions for the Compression Lemma. Specifically, the condition $4 \\ln(2n) \\le d_{comp} < g$ implies that $p = \\frac{d_{comp}}{g}$ is in the interval $(0,1)$. Furthermore, we have $d=g > \\Delta(H_{Base})$, since each component subgraph has at most $g$ vertices. It also holds that $d=g = \\frac{d_{comp}}{d_{comp}/g} > \\frac{4 \\ln(2n)}{p}$. Thus, the parameters $p$ and $d$ meet the required constraints.\nConsequently, we can apply the Compression Lemma, which guarantees the existence of a message $\\phi$ for which the missed-edge graph $H_{Miss}(\\phi) = (V, E_{Miss}(\\phi))$ has a bounded number of edges:\n$$|E_{Miss}(\\phi)| \\le \\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1) \\cdot g}{d_{comp}}$$\nNext, we apply the $\\text{SPLIT}$ function to $H_{Miss}(\\phi)$ with the parameter $d_{filter}$, yielding a pair of vertex sets $(L,Q)$. According to Proposition 3.3, the size of $Q$ is bounded by $|Q| \\le \\frac{2|E_{Miss}(\\phi)|}{d_{filter}}$, which in turn is at most $\\frac{2 \\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1) g}{d_{comp} \\cdot d_{filter}}$. This proves Item 5.\nWe then define the collection of vertex sets $\\mathcal{P}$ as $\\{S \\cap L : S \\in \\mathcal{H}\\}$. Since $\\mathcal{H}$ is a partition of $V$ and $Q$ is the complement of $L$ in $V$, the collection $\\mathcal{P} \\cup \\{Q\\}$ forms a partition of $V$. By Fact 2.1, the size of $\\mathcal{P}$ is equal to the size of $\\mathcal{H}$, so $|\\mathcal{P}| = |\\mathcal{H}| \\le \\lceil \\frac{n}{g} \\rceil$, which proves Item 4.\nIt remains to verify the properties for every set $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$. Let $X_P$ denote the subgraph $H_{Miss}(\\phi)[P]$.\n*   From Proposition 3.3, because $P \\subseteq L$, we have $\\Delta(X_P) \\le \\Delta(H_{Miss}(\\phi)[L]) \\le d_{filter}$. This confirms Item 3.\n*   By definition, any $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$ is a subset of some $S \\in \\mathcal{H}$. Our initial construction of $H_{Base}$ ensures that $H_{Base}[S] = G_{Base}[S]$. As $P$ is a subset of $S$, it follows that $H_{Base}[P] = G_{Base}[P]$, proving Item 2.\n\nSecond, consider the case where $d_{comp} \\ge g$. In this situation, we set the distribution to be $\\mathcal{H} = \\mathcal{G}(H_{Base}, 1, |V|)$. We define $\\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{H}$, which implies that $Q = \\emptyset$. An empty set for $Q$ trivially satisfies the size constraint in Item 5. This choice of parameters makes the distribution $\\mathcal{H}$ deterministic, with its support containing only the single graph $H_{Base}$. The maximum degree of $H_{Base}$ is at most $g$ (since each component in $\\mathcal{H}$ has at most $g$ vertices), and since $g \\le d_{comp}$, we have $\\Delta(H_{Base}) \\le g \\le 2 \\cdot d_{comp}$. This satisfies Item 1. As $|\\mathcal{P}| = |\\mathcal{H}|$, Item 4 follows directly from Fact 2.1. Because the support of $\\mathcal{H}$ is just $\\{H_{Base}\\}$, there is no ambiguity for the compressor, so the missed-edge graph is empty, $H_{Miss}(\\phi) = \\emptyset$. This proves Item 3. Finally, by our definitions of $\\mathcal{P}$ and $H_{Base}$, for any $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the equality $G_{Base}[P] = H_{Base}[P]$ holds, which verifies Item 2.",
