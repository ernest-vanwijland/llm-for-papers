  "proof": "We will use a probabilistic argument.\n\nFirstly, if $d \\le 16 \\ln(n)$, then we let H be the empty graph. Since $\\Delta(G) \\le \\Delta$, the largest clique in G has size $\\le \\Delta$. Indeed, $16 \\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{d} + 10 \\ge 16 \\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{16 \\ln(n)} = \\Delta$.\n\nSimilarly, if $\\Delta \\le d$, then take $H=G$. The largest clique size is 1 and $\\Delta(H) \\le \\Delta \\le d$. Finally, if $n \\le 10$ then the largest clique size is at most 10, so we can let S be the empty graph as well.\n\nIt remains to prove the lemma for $n > 10$ and $16 \\ln(n) < d < \\Delta$. We choose S by sampling each edge in G with probability $\\frac{d}{2\\Delta}$. For any vertex v, we let $X_1, \\dots, X_{deg(v)}$ be indicator variables for whether an incident edge is chosen. If we let $X := \\sum_{i=1}^{deg(v)} X_i$, then $\\mathbb{E}[X] \\le \\frac{d}{2}$. By Proposition 2.2 with $\\epsilon=1$,\n$$ Pr(X > d) \\le Pr(X > 2 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[X]) \\le \\exp(-\\frac{\\frac{d}{2}}{4}) < \\exp(-\\frac{16 \\ln n}{8}) = \\exp(-2 \\ln n). $$\nHence, by a union bound, Pr(Some vertex in H has degree greater than d) does not exceed\n$$ n \\cdot \\exp(-2 \\ln n) = \\exp(\\ln n - 2 \\ln n) = \\exp(-\\ln n) = \\frac{1}{n}. $$\nFinally, we calculate the probability that this procedure yields a subgraph H satisfying Item 1 and Item 2. Through a union bound on the complement, when $n>10$, we get\n$$ \\text{Pr(H does not satisfy Item 1 or Item 2)} \\le \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{100} < 1. $$\nThus, there is some H satisfying the two conditions.",
