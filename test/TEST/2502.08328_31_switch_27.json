  "proof": "Proof. By Lemmas 33, and 34, whp all vertex sets in G with size at least $\\ge \\eta n$ have average degree is at least $3d/4$. Also by the second part of the first Lemma, whp, for any vertex set $S \\subseteq V_G$ with size between $\\eta n$ and $(1-\\eta)n$, $|E_G(S,S)| \\ge \\frac{5d}{6}|S|(n-|S|)$. Also whp $n_C \\ge (1-e^{-d/3})n$. Assume further on G satisfies these properties.\nAlso by the choice of $\\eta$ and by Lemma 12, whp G is such that for any $F \\in \\Omega_C^{\\text{ord}}$, there is a giant component in $(V_C, F)$ with total degree $\\ge \\frac{9}{10}\\text{degg}(V_C)$. Thus the set $S$ of vertices in the non-giant components has total degree $\\le \\frac{1}{10}\\text{degg}(V_C)$. Note that all edges in $E_G(S,S)$ are in $E_C \\setminus F$. We consider three cases, based on the size of S.\nNext consider the case $\\eta n \\le |S| \\le \\frac{n}{2}$. Then $|E_C \\setminus F| \\ge |E_G(S,S)| \\ge \\frac{5\\eta nd}{12}$. But whp $|E_C| \\le \\frac{dn}{2}+o(n) < \\frac{3dn}{4}$, so this contradicts $|E_C \\setminus F| \\le \\eta|E_C|$.\nIf $|S| \\ge \\frac{n}{2}$, then $\\text{degg}(S) > \\frac{dn}{4}$. But also $\\text{degg}(S) \\le \\frac{\\text{degg}(V_C)}{10} < \\frac{dn}{10}+o(n)$, which is a contradiction.\nThus the only remaining possibility is $|S| \\le \\eta n$. Then $c(F) \\le |S| \\le \\eta n + 1$ and $|F| < |E_C| \\le nd/2+\\eta n$ (the last inequality holds whp). Thus we obtain that $w_C(F) < q^{\\eta n+1}(e^\\beta - 1)^{nd/2+\\eta n} < q^{\\eta n+2-1/10 \\cdot nd/d+\\eta n} = q^{n[1-1/20+2\\eta]}$.\nSince $\\emptyset$ is a configuration with a weight $q^{n_C} > q^{n(1-e^{-d/3})}$, it follows that $Z_C > q^{n-ne^{-d/3}}$. There are at most $2^{|E_C|} = 2^{nd/2+\\eta n}$ ordered configurations, therefore,\n$$ \\frac{Z_C^{\\text{dis}}}{Z_C} < 2^{nd/2+\\eta n}q^{n[\\eta-1+1-1/10+2\\eta+e^{-d/3}]} = \\exp\\{n[d\\ln 2/2 + \\log q(-1/10+2\\eta+e^{-d/3})]\\}. $$\nSince $1/10 - 2\\eta - e^{-d/3} > 1/20$ for all d large enough, this becomes $\\exp\\{nd \\ln 2/2 - n \\log q/20\\}$, which is $\\le e^{-n}$ for all q large enough.",
