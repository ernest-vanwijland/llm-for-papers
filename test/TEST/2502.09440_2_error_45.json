  "proof": "Proof. Let $P := \\{v \\in V : \\deg(v) \\leq b\\}$. Then, $Q := V \\setminus P$. This is clearly a partition, since each vertex is in exactly one of $P$ or $Q$.\n\nWe will now prove the bound on $G[P]$. For every vertex $v \\in P$, $\\deg(v) \\leq b$ in $G$. Since $G[P]$ is a subgraph of $G$, $\\deg(v) \\leq b$ in $G[P]$ as well. Hence, $\\Delta(G[P]) \\leq b$.\n\nNow for the bound on $|Q|$. By definition of $Q$, every vertex $v \\in Q$ has $\\deg(v) > b$. The degree of a vertex in the induced subgraph $G[Q]$ must be equal to its degree in the full graph $G$, so we have $\\deg_{G[Q]}(v) > b$ for all $v \\in Q$. The number of edges in $G[Q]$ is thus\n$$ |E(G[Q])| = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in Q} \\deg_{G[Q]}(v) > \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in Q} b = \\frac{1}{2} |Q| \\cdot b. $$\nSince $G[Q]$ is a subgraph of $G$, we have $|E(G[Q])| \\leq m$. Combining these gives $m > \\frac{1}{2} |Q| \\cdot b$, and we rearrange to get $|Q| < \\frac{2m}{b}$.",
