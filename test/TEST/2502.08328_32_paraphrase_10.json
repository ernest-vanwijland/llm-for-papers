  "proof": "We begin by considering a configuration $F \\in \\Omega_C^{\\mathrm{dis}}$. The size of this configuration is bounded by $|F| \\le \\eta|E_C|$, which in turn provides an upper bound on its weight, $w_C(F) \\le q^{n_C} (e^\\beta - 1)^{\\eta|E_C|}$. The total number of configurations in $\\Omega_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}$ is at most $|\\Omega_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}| \\le 2^{|E_C|}$. Since the entire edge set $F = E_C$ constitutes a valid configuration, we can establish a lower bound for the partition function $Z_C \\ge q(e^\\beta-1)^{|E_C|}$. With high probability, the number of edges satisfies $|E_C| \\le \\frac{dn}{2} + \\eta n$, which implies that $|\\Omega_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}| \\le 2^{n(d/2+\\eta)}$. By combining these inequalities and using the condition that $\\beta \\ge \\beta_1$, we can bound the ratio of the partition functions:\n$$\n\\frac{Z_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}}{Z_C} \\le \\frac{2^{(d/2+\\eta)n}q^{n_C}(e^\\beta - 1)^{-(1-\\eta)|E_C|}}{q} \\le q^{n-(1-\\eta)(2+1/10)|E_C|}.\n$$\nFrom Lemma 39, we know that with high probability $|E_C| \\ge \\frac{dn}{2} - 2ne^{-d/3}$. Substituting this lower bound into our inequality gives\n$$\n\\frac{Z_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}}{Z_C} \\le q^{n[1-(1-\\eta)(2+1/10)(d/2-2e^{-d/3})/d]} \\le q^{-n[1/20-2\\eta+5e^{-d/3}/d]}.\n$$\nDue to the choice of $\\eta$, for a sufficiently large $d$, this expression is at most $q^{-n/40}$. Therefore, for all sufficiently large $q$, the ratio is at most $e^{-n}$.",
