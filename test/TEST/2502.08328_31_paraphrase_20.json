  "proof": "According to Lemmas 33 and 34, with high probability, any vertex set in $G$ of size at least $\\eta n$ has an average degree of at least $3d/4$. Furthermore, one of these lemmas also establishes that, with high probability, any vertex set $S \\subseteq V_G$ whose size is between $\\eta n$ and $(1-\\eta)n$ satisfies the inequality $|E_G(S,S)| \\ge \\frac{5d}{6}|S|(n-|S|)$. With high probability, it also holds that $n_C \\ge (1-e^{-d/3})n$. For the remainder of the proof, we will assume that the graph $G$ satisfies all of these properties.\n\nBased on our choice of $\\eta$ and by Lemma 12, it holds with high probability that for any given configuration $F \\in \\Omega_C^{\\text{ord}}$, the graph $(V_C, F)$ contains a giant component with a total degree of at least $\\frac{9}{10}\\text{degg}(V_C)$. Consequently, if we define $S$ as the set of vertices belonging to the non-giant components, the total degree of $S$ is at most $\\frac{1}{10}\\text{degg}(V_C)$. We should note that any edge in $E_G(S,S)$ must belong to the set $E_C \\setminus F$. We proceed by considering three distinct cases based on the size of the set $S$.\n\nFirst, suppose that $|S| \\ge \\frac{n}{2}$. In this case, the total degree of $S$ must be greater than $\\frac{dn}{4}$. However, we also know that $\\text{degg}(S) \\le \\frac{\\text{degg}(V_C)}{10}$, which is less than $\\frac{dn}{10}+o(n)$. These two bounds on $\\text{degg}(S)$ contradict each other.\n\nSecond, let's consider the case where $\\eta n \\le |S| \\le \\frac{n}{2}$. This implies that $|E_C \\setminus F| \\ge |E_G(S,S)| \\ge \\frac{5\\eta nd}{12}$. With high probability, however, we have $|E_C| \\le \\frac{dn}{2}+o(n) < \\frac{3dn}{4}$, which leads to a contradiction with the property that $|E_C \\setminus F| \\le \\eta|E_C|$.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that $|S| \\le \\eta n$. In this situation, the number of components $c(F)$ is bounded by $|S|$, which is at most $\\eta n + 1$. Additionally, the number of edges $|F|$ is less than $|E_C|$, which with high probability is at most $nd/2+\\eta n$. As a result, we can bound the weight $w_C(F)$, obtaining $w_C(F) < q^{\\eta n+1}(e^\\beta - 1)^{nd/2+\\eta n}$. This is in turn strictly less than $q^{\\eta n+2-1/10 \\cdot nd/d+\\eta n}$, an expression that is equal to $q^{n[1-1/20+2\\eta]}$.\n\nConsidering that the empty set $\\emptyset$ is a configuration with weight $q^{n_C} > q^{n(1-e^{-d/3})}$, it follows that the partition function $Z_C$ must be greater than $q^{n-ne^{-d/3}}$. The total number of ordered configurations is at most $2^{|E_C|} = 2^{nd/2+\\eta n}$, which allows us to bound the ratio $\\frac{Z_C^{\\text{dis}}}{Z_C}$ as follows:\n$$ \\frac{Z_C^{\\text{dis}}}{Z_C} < 2^{nd/2+\\eta n}q^{n[\\eta-1+1-1/10+2\\eta+e^{-d/3}]} = \\exp\\{n[d\\ln 2/2 + \\log q(-1/10+2\\eta+e^{-d/3})]\\}. $$\nFor a sufficiently large value of $d$, the inequality $1/10 - 2\\eta - e^{-d/3} > 1/20$ is satisfied. Consequently, the expression above is bounded by $\\exp\\{nd \\ln 2/2 - n \\log q/20\\}$. For a sufficiently large value of $q$, this final term is less than or equal to $e^{-n}$.",
