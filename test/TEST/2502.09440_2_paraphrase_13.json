  "proof": "We begin by partitioning the set of vertices $V$ into two sets. Let $P$ be the set of vertices with a degree of at most $b$, formally $P := \\{v \\in V : \\deg(v) \\leq b\\}$. We then define $Q$ to be the complement of this set, $Q := V \\setminus P$. This constitutes a partition of $V$ because each vertex belongs to one and only one of these two sets.\n\nNext, we will prove the bound on the subgraph induced by $P$, denoted $G[P]$. For any vertex $v$ in the set $P$, its degree in the graph $G$ is, by definition, no more than $b$. Since $G[P]$ is a subgraph of $G$, the degree of any vertex in $G[P]$ cannot exceed its degree in $G$. Thus, the degree of $v$ in $G[P]$ is also at most $b$. From this, it follows that the maximum degree of the subgraph $G[P]$ is bounded by $b$, so $\\Delta(G[P]) \\leq b$.\n\nNow, we will establish the bound on the size of $Q$. We use the well-known property that the number of edges is equivalent to half the sum of all vertex degrees. This allows us to write the following series of relations:\n$$ m = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v) \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in V \\setminus P} \\deg(v) \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in Q} b = \\frac{1}{2} |Q| \\cdot b. $$\nBy rearranging this inequality to solve for $|Q|$, we obtain the result $|Q| \\leq \\frac{2m}{b}$.",
