  "proof": "Proof. It is sufficient to prove the stronger statement that $\\{H_i : i \\in [k]\\} \\cup \\{R_{i+1} : i \\in [k]\\}$ is disjoint. For each $i \\in [k]$, by Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5, $H_{\\text{Base}}(i) \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$ and $R_{i+1} \\subseteq H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i) \\subseteq H_{\\text{Base}}(i) \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$. Hence, both $H_i$ and $R_{i+1}$ are subgraphs of $G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$.\n\nFirstly, we claim that $H_i$ and $R_{i+1}$ are edge-disjoint. In particular, since $H_i$ is sampled from $\\text{supp}(\\mathcal{H}_i)$ and $\\Phi_i(H_i) = M_i$, by definition, we know that none of the edges in $H_i$ are in $H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)$. However, $R_{i+1} \\subseteq H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)$, so none of the edges in $R_{i+1}$ are in $H_i$.\n\nNext, we prove that $G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$ is edge-disjoint with $H_i$ and $R_{i+1}$. For any edge in $H_i$, it is in $H_{\\text{Base}}(i)$ but not $H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)$. Hence, it is not in $G_{\\text{Base}}(i) - (H_{\\text{Base}}(i) - H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i))$. For $R_{i+1}$, by Lemma 3.5, its edges are contained in $H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)$ and are therefore not in the set of removed edges $H_{\\text{Base}}(i) - H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)$. Thus, none of the edges in $R_{i+1}$ appear in $G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1) = (G_{\\text{Base}}(i) - (H_{\\text{Base}}(i) - H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)))[Q_i]$.\n\nFinally, for any $j > i$, we know that $G_{\\text{Base}}(j) \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$. Thus, for any edge $(u,v)$ in $H_i$ or $R_{i+1}$, we know that $(u,v)$ is not in $G_{\\text{Base}}(j)$ (since $(u,v) \\notin G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$). Since $H_j$ and $R_{j+1}$ are subgraphs of $G_{\\text{Base}}(j)$, $(u,v)$ will not be in $H_j$ or $R_{j+1}$ either.\n\nThus, an edge in $H_i$ or $R_{i+1}$ (it only appears in one of the two) will not be sent in any $H_j$ or $R_{j+1}$ if $j > i$. As such, $\\{H_i : i \\in [k]\\} \\cup \\{R_{i+1} : i \\in [k]\\}$ is edge-disjoint. Since $R_1$ is empty, this set contains all the graphs sent to any player. Hence, no two players will receive the same edge.",
