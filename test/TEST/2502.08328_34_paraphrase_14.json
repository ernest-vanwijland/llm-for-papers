  "proof": "Let us consider an arbitrary configuration $F$ from the set $B_1$. As was shown in Case 0 of the proof of Lemma 53, the graph $(V_C, F)$ has at most $(1 - \\frac{2\\eta}{3})n$ singleton components. We define $S$ to be the set of vertices belonging to components of size 2 or more. It is clear that all endpoints of the edges in $F$ must lie in $S$, and therefore $|F| \\le e_G(S)$. By combining Lemmas 29, 30, and 35, we find that for a sufficiently large $d$, it holds with high probability that any connected subset $S' \\subseteq S$ of $(V_C, F)$ satisfies $e_G(S') \\le |S'|(1+\\max(1, d\\eta/3))$. From this, it follows that $e_G(S) \\le |S|(2+d\\eta/3)$. Since we have $e_G(S) \\ge |F| \\ge \\frac{9\\eta}{10}|E_C|$, we can establish a lower bound on the size of $S$, namely $|S| \\ge \\frac{9\\eta|E_C|}{10d(\\eta/3+2/d)}$. Because each component that contributes vertices to $S$ has a size of at least 2, the total number of components, $c(F)$, is bounded by $c(F) \\le n - |S| + |S|/2 = n - |S|/2$. This allows us to bound the ratio of weights:\n$$ \\frac{w_G(F)}{w_G(\\emptyset)} = q^{n-\\frac{|S|}{2} - n_C}(e^\\beta-1)^{|F|} \\le q^{n - \\frac{9\\eta|E_C|}{20d(\\eta/3+2/d)} - n_C} (e^{\\beta_1}-1)^{\\eta|E_C|} $$\nThe second inequality in this expression holds because $\\beta \\le \\beta_1$ and, with high probability, $n_C \\ge n(1-e^{-d/3})$. For any sufficiently large $d$, the inequality $\\frac{9}{2(\\eta/3+2/d)}-21 > 1$ is satisfied. By Lemma 39, it holds with high probability that $|E_C| \\ge \\frac{dn}{2} - 2ne^{-d/3} \\ge \\frac{dn}{3}$. These facts together imply that $\\frac{w_C(F)}{Z_C^{\\text{dis}}} < q^{-n[\\eta/20-e^{-d/3}]}$. For a large enough $d$, this bound is at most $q^{-n\\eta/30}$. By aggregating this result over the total number of configurations $F$, which is at most $2^{|E_C|} \\le 2^{dn}$, we find that for all sufficiently large $q$, the probability $\\pi_C^{\\text{dis}}(B_1)$ is at most $e^{-n}$.",
