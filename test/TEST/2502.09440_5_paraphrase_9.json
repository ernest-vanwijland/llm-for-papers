  "proof": "We will prove the stronger statement that the set of graphs $\\{H_i : i \\in [k]\\} \\cup \\{R_{i+1} : i \\in [k]\\}$ is disjoint, which is a sufficient condition. For any $i \\in [k]$, Lemmas 3.4 and 3.5 show that $H_{\\text{Base}}(i) \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$ and $R_{i+1} \\subseteq H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i) \\subseteq H_{\\text{Base}}(i) \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$. This implies that $H_i$ and $R_{i+1}$ are both subgraphs of $G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$.\n\nFirst, we argue that $H_i$ and $R_{i+1}$ are edge-disjoint. By construction, $H_i$ is sampled from $\\text{supp}(\\mathcal{H}_i)$ with the property that $\\Phi_i(H_i) = M_i$. By definition, this means that no edges from $H_i$ are in $H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)$. However, since $R_{i+1}$ is a subgraph of $H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)$, it follows that no edge in $R_{i+1}$ can be in $H_i$.\n\nSecond, we show that $G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$ shares no edges with $H_i$ or $R_{i+1}$. Any edge in $H_i$ must be in $H_{\\text{Base}}(i)$ but not in $H_{\\text{Miss}}(i)$. It is therefore not in the graph $G_{\\text{Base}}(i) - (H_{\\text{Base}}(i) - H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i))$. Regarding $R_{i+1}$, Lemma 3.5 guarantees that none of its edges are incident to any vertex in $Q_i$. Consequently, no edge from $R_{i+1}$ can exist in $G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$, which is defined as the induced subgraph $(G_{\\text{Base}}(i) - (H_{\\text{Base}}(i) - H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)))[Q_i]$.\n\nFinally, for any $j > i$, we have the nesting property $G_{\\text{Base}}(j) \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$. Therefore, for any edge $(u,v)$ that is in either $H_i$ or $R_{i+1}$, we know $(u,v)$ is not in $G_{\\text{Base}}(j)$ because it is not in $G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$. Since $H_j$ and $R_{j+1}$ are themselves subgraphs of $G_{\\text{Base}}(j)$, the edge $(u,v)$ cannot be in $H_j$ or $R_{j+1}$.\n\nIn summary, an edge that appears in $H_i$ or $R_{i+1}$ (and it can only be in one of the two) will not be present in any $H_j$ or $R_{j+1}$ for $j > i$. This confirms that the set $\\{H_i : i \\in [k]\\} \\cup \\{R_{i+1} : i \\in [k]\\}$ is edge-disjoint. As $R_1$ is empty, this set includes all graphs distributed to the players. We conclude that no two players receive an identical edge.",
