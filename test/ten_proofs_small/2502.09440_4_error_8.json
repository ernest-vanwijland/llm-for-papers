  "proof": "Proof. For all $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, by Lemma 3.1 on $H[P]$ and $d_{\\text{remove}}$, there is a graph $R_P$ with degree $\\le d_{\\text{remove}}$ s.t. the minimum clique size in $H[P] - R_P$ is $\\le 17 \\ln(n) \\frac{d_{\\text{filter}}}{d_{\\text{remove}}} + 10$.\nWe take $R := \\bigcap_{P \\in \\mathcal{P}} R_P$. Since $Q$ is disjoint with all sets in $\\mathcal{P}$, none of the edges in $R$ are incident to any vertex in $Q$. Additionally, for all $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, since $R_P \\subseteq R$ and the vertex sets in $\\mathcal{P}$ are disjoint, we have $R_P = R[P]$. Thus, the largest clique in $(H - R)[P] = H[P] - R_P$ has size $\\le 16 \\ln(n) \\frac{d_{\\text{filter}}}{d_{\\text{remove}}} + 10$.",
