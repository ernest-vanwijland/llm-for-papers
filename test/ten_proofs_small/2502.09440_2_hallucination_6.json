  "proof": "Proof. Let $P := \\{v \\in V : \\deg(v) \\leq b\\}$. Then, $Q := V \\setminus P$. This is clearly a partition, since each vertex is in exactly one of $P$ or $Q$.\n\nWe will now prove the bound on $G[P]$. For every vertex $v \\in P$, $\\deg(v) \\leq b$ in $G$. Since $G[P]$ is a subgraph of $G$, $\\deg(v) \\leq b$ in $G[P]$ as well. Hence, $\\Delta(G[P]) \\leq b$.\n\nNow for the bound on $|Q|$. We apply Proposition 3.2 to obtain $|Q| \\leq \\frac{2m}{b}$. This completes the proof of the Proposition.",
