  "proof": "Proof. Let $G_{k,n}$ be a minimal induced subgraph of $H_n$ that is not a k-leaf power. It is strongly chordal because, by Lemma 2.4, $H_n$ is strongly chordal. By definition, $G_{k,n}$ is not in $\\mathcal{L}(k)$, but every induced subgraph $G$ of $G_{k,n}$ is in $\\mathcal{L}(k)$ if $G \\neq G_{k,n}$. It remains to prove that $|G_{k,n}| \\ge n$. By Lemma 2.4, both $H_n$ – Bot and $H_n$ – Top are in $\\mathcal{L}(k)$. Therefore, $G_{k,n}$ must contain a vertex from Top and a vertex from Bot. Moreover, $G_{k,n}$ is connected by its minimality, since the disjoint union of k-leaf powers is a k-leaf power. Hence, $G_{k,n}$ must contain a path from Top to Bot. By Lemma 2.4, dist$_{H_n}(b, t) \\ge n$, and therefore $|G_{k,n}| \\ge n$. ☐",
