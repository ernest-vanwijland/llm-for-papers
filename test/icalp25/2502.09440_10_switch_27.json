  "proof": "Proof. Suppose a deterministic algorithm exists. Then, by Lemma 2.3, there is a set of $k = [\\ln n]+1$ players that can solve the INDEPENDENT-SET($n, \\Delta, k, s$) problem with the same independent set size. After all, if Player $k$ outputs an independent set of size greater than $\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2} + \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2} \\cdot k \\cdot (96\\ell^2 \\ln(n) + 30)$, then we can find another set of edges to send such that each player sends the same message but the independent set is no longer valid. However, by Lemma 4.5, this is impossible.",
