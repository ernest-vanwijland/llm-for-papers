  "proof": "Proof. Here, $k > 0$ will be a sufficiently large constant we specify later.\nFix $1 \\le s < \\log n$. We union bound over connected trees of size $s$ and events \"$T$ is a subtree of $G$ with $e(V(T)) > s - 1 + k$\". Fix any tree $T$ of size $s$. Then note that conditional on $T$ being a subgraph of $G$, we have that $e(V(T)) \\sim s - 1 + \\text{Bin}(\\binom{s}{2} - (s - 1), d/n) \\le s + \\text{Bin}(s^2, d/n)$.\nWe have $\\text{P}(\\text{Bin}(s^2,d/n) \\ge k) \\le s^{2k}(d/n)^k$ by union bound. Lemma 31 gives that the expected number of connected trees of size $s$ is at most $n(ed)^s$, thus expected number of subtrees $T$ of $G$ of size $s$ and $> s - 1 + k$ edges between vertices of $T$ is at most\n$$ \\left(\\frac{ds^2}{n}\\right)^k n(ed)^s = n \\exp\\{s \\log(ed) + k\\log(\\frac{ds^2}{n})\\} < d^k n\\exp\\{\\log(ed) \\log n - k \\log(\\frac{n}{\\log^2 n})\\} $$\nFor $k > \\log(ed) + 2$ and all $n$ large enough, this is $\\le \\frac{d^k}{n}$. Then union bound over $\\log n$ possible sizes and then using Markov inequality gives probability $\\le \\log n/\\sqrt{n} = o(1)$.",
