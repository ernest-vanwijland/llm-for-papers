  "proof": "Based on Proposition 10 and Lemma 35, a positive real constant $A$ exists such that for any sufficiently large $d$, it holds with high probability that all connected sets $S$ of size at least $A\\log(n)/d$ have a total degree of $\\mathrm{degg}(S) > \\frac{9d}{10}|S|$. If, in addition, the set size satisfies $|S| \\le \\frac{n}{6}$, then the number of internal edges is bounded by $e_G(S) \\le (1+\\frac{1}{5})|S|$.\n\nThe total degree of a set $S$ is given by the identity $\\mathrm{degg}(S) = 2e_G(S) + |E_G(S,S)|$, where $|E_G(S,S)|$ is the number of edges with one endpoint in $S$ and the other in its complement. By rearranging this equation and applying the inequalities mentioned above, we can conclude that for any connected vertex set $S$ with $A\\log(n)/d \\le |S| \\le \\frac{n}{6}$:\n$$\n\\frac{|E_G(S,S)|}{\\mathrm{degg}(S)} = 1 - \\frac{2e_G(S)}{\\mathrm{degg}(S)} \\ge 1 - \\frac{20}{9d} - \\frac{1}{5}.\n$$\nFor a sufficiently large $d$, this quantity is at most $\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nTo complete the proof, we observe that if a set has size $|S| \\ge \\frac{n}{6}$, its total degree is at least $\\frac{3dn}{10}$. With high probability, this value is greater than the total number of edges in the graph, $|E_G|$, and therefore also greater than the number of edges in the component $C$, which means $\\frac{\\mathrm{degg}(V_c)}{10} < \\frac{3nd}{10} < \\mathrm{degg}(S)$. Consequently, any set $S$ that satisfies $\\mathrm{degg}(S) \\le \\mathrm{degg}(V_c)/10$ must also have a size of $|S| \\le n/6$. This implies that the expansion property is applicable.",
