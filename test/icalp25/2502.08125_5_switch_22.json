  "proof": "Proof. Fix $\\tau$. Let $h_t$ be the number of edges in $\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)$ that have arrived by time $t$. To begin, we claim that at any time $t$, each edge $e \\in \\text{LOW}(\\tau)$ is at most $\\tau + h_t$ slots ahead of its true position, i.e., $\\text{index}_t(e) - \\text{index}(e) \\le \\tau + h_t$. This is true at $t = 0$ by definition. For sake of contradiction, consider the first time $t$ at which this condition does not hold for some edge $e$, i.e., $\\text{index}_{t-1}(e) - \\text{index}(e) \\le \\tau + h_{t-1}$, but $\\text{index}_t(e) - \\text{index}(e) > \\tau + h_t$. Notice that at each time the position of an edge can increase by at most 1, so the above can only happen if $\\text{index}_t(e) = \\text{index}_{t-1}(e) + 1$ and $h_t = h_{t-1}$, meaning the edge $e'$ inserted at time $t$ is in $\\text{LOW}(\\tau)$. Since insertion of $e'$ changes the position of $e$, $e'$ must have jumped from a position greater than $\\text{index}_{t-1}(e)$ to position $t$. Thus $\\text{index}_{t-1}(e') > \\text{index}_{t-1}(e)$. Also note that since $e'$ has jumped over $e$ in the updated predictions, it means that $e$ has not arrived yet, i.e., $\\text{index}(e) > t = \\text{index}(e')$. Therefore,\n$$ \\text{index}_{t-1}(e') - \\text{index}(e') > \\text{index}_{t-1}(e) - \\text{index}(e)+2 = \\text{index}_t(e) - \\text{index}(e)+1 > \\tau + h_t = \\tau + h_{t-1}, $$\nwhich contradicts the choice of $t$.\n\nNow, fix a position $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$. At each time $t$, either no jump happens, or some edge jumps from position $t' > t$ to position $t$. Consider the first time $t^*$ an edge $e \\in \\text{LOW}(\\tau)$ jumps over $i$. We want to show that $t^*$ cannot be “much smaller” than $i$. Assume this jump is from position $t' > i$ to position $t^* < i$. So, the position of $e$ at time $t^* - 1$ in the updated prediction is $t'$, i.e., $\\text{index}_{t^*-1}(e) = t'$. Also, the actual position of $e$ is $t^*$, i.e., $\\text{index}(e) = t^*$. We know that\n$$ t' - t^* = \\text{index}_{t^*-1}(e) - \\text{index}(e) \\le \\tau + h_{t^*-1} \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|, $$\nwhich means that $i - t^* < t' - t^* \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n\nAlso, after time $i$, no edge can jump over $i$. Before time $t^*$, all the edges that might have jumped over $i$ are in $\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)$. So there are at most $|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$ jumps over $i$ before time $t^*$. Therefore, the total number of jumps over $i$ is at most $|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)| + (i - t^* + 1) \\le \\tau + 2|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.",
