  "proof": "Proof. If $t = m$, then $v$ cannot be dead at time $t$. Otherwise, since $1 \\le t \\le m-1$, $t$ is the midpoint of some subproblem $[l, r]$ with $r-l \\ge 2$, which means $l < t$. If $v$ is dead at time $t$, then $\\tilde{d}^l(v) = \\tilde{d}^t(v)$. If $l = t-1$, the claim is proven. Otherwise, we must have $t-1 \\in (l, t)$. The computation for time $t-1$ occurs in the recursive call on the subproblem $[l, t-1]$. In this recursive structure, the distance estimates from the parent's midpoint are passed down to its children for further refinement. Since $v$ is dead at time $t$, its distance estimate $\\tilde{d}^t(v)$ is passed as the initial estimate for the subproblem $[l, t-1]$. As $v$ remains dead, no updates will apply, and thus $\\tilde{d}^{t-1}(v) = \\tilde{d}^t(v)$.",
