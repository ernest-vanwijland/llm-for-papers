  "proof": "Proof. We have $\\Delta \\sim N(d - \\mu, 1/n)$, thus whp $d - \\mu - \\frac{1}{2}e^{-d/3} < \\Delta$. For $d \\ge 3$, $\\mu \\le e^{-d/2} < e^{-d/3}$, hence $\\Delta > d - \\frac{3}{2}e^{-d/3}$.\nFrom the previous lemma, whp $n-n_K \\le ne^{-d/3}$. Also, we can write $2|E_K| \\ge \\sum^n D_i - 3(n-n_K)$. It is therefore enough to show that whp $\\sum^n D_i \\ge n(d-e^{-d/3})$. Since the probability of $\\sum D_i$ being even is bounded below by a constant, it is enough to show that whp $\\text{Poisson}(\\Delta n) \\ge n(d-e^{-d/3})$. Since $\\Delta \\ge d - \\frac{3}{2}e^{-d/3}$ whp, we have from (9) that $P(\\text{Poisson}(\\Delta n) \\le n(d-e^{-d/3})) = e^{-\\Omega(n)})$. The result for $G(n, d/n)$ follows from contiguity of $K(n, d)$.",
