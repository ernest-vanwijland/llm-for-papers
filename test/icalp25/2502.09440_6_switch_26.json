  "proof": "Proof. We consider the degree on each vertex $v$. Firstly, there is at most one value of $i$ for which $v$ is incident to some edge in $R_i$. After all, by Lemma 3.5, if an edge in $R_i$ is incident to $v$, then $v \\notin Q_{i-1}$ and $v$ is not in $G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$ nor any subsequent graphs. For this value of $i$, $\\Delta(R_i) \\le \\frac{\\Delta}{l}$. Furthermore, $\\Delta(H_j) \\le \\frac{2\\Delta}{l}$ for all $j \\in [k]$ by Lemma 3.4. Thus, $\\text{deg}(v)$ cannot exceed $\\frac{\\Delta}{l}$ in $R_i$ nor $\\frac{2\\Delta}{l}$ in $H_j$ for any $j \\in [k]$.\nSince $G_{\\text{input}} = (\\cup_{i=1}^k H_i) \\cup (\\cup_{i=1}^k R_i)$, the degree of $v$ in $G_{\\text{input}}$ is the sum of its degree in each of these graphs. In particular, the degree of $v$ is $\\le k \\cdot \\frac{2\\Delta}{l} + \\frac{\\Delta}{l} \\le \\frac{4 \\ln(n) \\cdot \\Delta}{l} + \\frac{\\Delta}{l} < \\frac{\\Delta}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta}{2} = \\Delta$. The last is true by $l \\ge 8 \\ln n$. The second last inequality is true by $k = [\\ln(n)] + 1$ and $n > \\eta$.",
