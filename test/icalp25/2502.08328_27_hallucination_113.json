  "proof": "Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be the event that the statement fails. We aim to show that $P(\\mathcal{A}) = o(1)$ using the first moment method. Let $N$ be the random variable counting the number of \"bad\" configurations $\\gamma$, i.e., those for which $|V_G(\\gamma)| \\ge k_0 = \\lceil \\frac{A \\log n}{d} \\rceil$ and $w^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma) > q^{1-|V_G(\\gamma)|/10}$. We will show $\\mathbb{E}[N] = o(1)$.\n\nLet $N_k$ be the number of bad configurations $\\gamma$ with $|V_G(\\gamma)|=k$. Then $\\mathbb{E}[N] = \\sum_{k=k_0}^n \\mathbb{E}[N_k]$.\nFor a fixed $k$, we can bound $\\mathbb{E}[N_k]$ by summing over all vertex sets $S$ of size $k$ and all possible \"bad\" structures $\\gamma$ that can be supported on $S$. Let $\\Gamma'_k$ be the set of structures on $k$ vertices with $w^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma) > q^{1-k/10}$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N_k] \\le \\sum_{S \\subset V, |S|=k} \\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma'_k} P(\\text{$\\gamma$ is realized on } S) $$\nThe number of vertex sets is $\\binom{n}{k}$. From the properties of $\\Omega^{\\mathrm{dis}}$, the number of relevant structures $\\gamma$ on $k$ vertices is bounded, so we have $|\\Gamma'_k| \\le (\\beta d)^k q^{-k/10}$ for some constant $\\beta$ related to $\\beta_1$.\n\nThe probability that a specific structure $\\gamma$ with $e(\\gamma)$ edges is realized on $S$ is $p^{e(\\gamma)}(1-p)^{\\binom{k}{2}-e(\\gamma)}$, where $p=d/n$. A key property of the configurations in $\\Gamma^{\\mathrm{dis}}(F)$ is that they must be 'balanced' and sparse. This means the number of edges $e(\\gamma)$ is proportional to the number of vertices, specifically $e(\\gamma) \\ge k/2$ for any such configuration to be stable. Thus, we can bound the probability of realization, which is dominated by the presence of the required edges, by $p^{k/2} = (d/n)^{k/2}$.\n\nCombining these bounds and using $\\binom{n}{k} \\le (\\frac{ne}{k})^k$, we have:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N_k] \\le \\left(\\frac{ne}{k}\\right)^k (\\beta d)^k q^{-k/10} \\left(\\frac{d}{n}\\right)^{k/2} $$\n$$ = \\left( \\frac{ne}{k} \\cdot \\beta d \\cdot q^{-1/10} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{d}{n}\\right)^{1/2} \\right)^k $$\n$$ = \\left( \\frac{e \\beta d^{3/2}}{k q^{1/10}} n^{1/2} \\right)^k $$\nFor $k \\ge k_0 = \\frac{A \\log n}{d}$, the base of the exponent is bounded by $\\frac{e \\beta d^{5/2}}{A q^{1/10} \\log n} n^{1/2}$. For a sufficiently large choice of the constant $A$, this quantity can be made smaller than $1$. Summing the resulting geometric series from $k=k_0$ to $n$ shows that $\\mathbb{E}[N] = o(1)$, and the result follows from Markov's inequality.",
