  "proof": "With high probability, we have the inequality $|E_C| < \\frac{dn}{2} + ne^{-d/3}$, which holds because $|E_C| \\le |E_G| = \\frac{nd}{2} + o(n)$. From a previous lemma, we also have the bound $|E_K| \\ge \\frac{dn}{2} - 2ne^{-d/3}$.\nThese two bounds allow us to bound the ratio of $|E_C|$ to $|E_K|$ as follows:\n$$ \\frac{|E_C|}{|E_K|} \\le \\frac{\\frac{dn}{2} + ne^{-d/3}}{\\frac{dn}{2} - 2ne^{-d/3}} = \\frac{d/2+e^{-d/3}}{d/2-2e^{-d/3}} = 1 + \\frac{3e^{-d/3}}{d/2-2e^{-d/3}}. $$\nWhen $d$ is sufficiently large, the fraction $\\frac{3}{d/2-2e^{-d/3}}$ is at most $1$. This implies that $|E_C|$ is no more than $(1+e^{-d/3})|E_K|$.",
