  "proof": "We will analyze the degree of an arbitrary vertex $v$. First, a vertex $v$ can be incident to edges from at most one graph $R_i$. The reason for this, as established by Lemma 3.5, is that if an edge in $R_i$ is incident to $v$, then $v$ is not in $Q_{i-1}$, nor is it in $G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$ or any of the subsequent graphs. For this single possible index $i$, the maximum degree is bounded by $\\Delta(R_i) \\le \\frac{\\Delta}{l}$. Additionally, Lemma 3.4 states that $\\Delta(H_j) \\le \\frac{2\\Delta}{l}$ for all $j \\in [k]$. Therefore, the degree of $v$ in any graph $R_i$ cannot be more than $\\frac{\\Delta}{l}$, and in any graph $H_j$ for any $j \\in [k]$, it cannot be more than $\\frac{2\\Delta}{l}$.\nSince the input graph is the union $G_{\\text{input}} = (\\cup_{i=1}^k H_i) \\cup (\\cup_{i=1}^k R_i)$, the degree of $v$ in $G_{\\text{input}}$ is the sum of its degrees in each of these constituent graphs. Consequently, the degree of $v$ is bounded by:\n$\\text{deg}(v) \\le k \\cdot \\frac{2\\Delta}{l} + \\frac{\\Delta}{l} \\le \\frac{4 \\ln(n) \\cdot \\Delta}{l} + \\frac{\\Delta}{l} < \\frac{\\Delta}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta}{2} = \\Delta$.\nThe second to last inequality in this chain is valid because $k = [\\ln(n)] + 1$ and $n > \\eta$. The final inequality holds true due to the condition $l \\ge 8 \\ln n$.",
