  "proof": "Proof. We have $|c/\\alpha|_1 \\le k$ and $|c/\\alpha|_\\infty \\le 1$. It is well known that $c/\\alpha$ is a convex combination of $\\{0,1\\}$-vectors, each of which has exactly $k$ 1's. For each $\\{0,1\\}$-vector $d$ in the combination, we have $\\sum_{r \\in V} d(r) \\text{cost}_C(r) \\le \\text{cost}_C^k$. Taking the convex combination of these inequalities gives $\\sum_{r \\in V} \\frac{c(r)}{\\alpha} \\text{cost}_C(r) \\le \\text{cost}_C^k$, which is equivalent to the inequality in the claim.",
