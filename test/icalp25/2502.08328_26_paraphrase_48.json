  "proof": "We are now prepared to prove Lemma 12. Our strategy involves first proving a related statement concerning degree-expander graphs. The subsequent lemma is an adaptation of [Tre16, Lemma 2.3].\n\nLet the components of the graph $(V_H, E_H \\setminus E')$ be denoted by $C_1, \\dots, C_k$, and without loss of generality, assume that $C_1$ is the component with the greatest total degree. We consider two cases.\n**Case 1.** Suppose that $\\mathrm{deg}_H(C_1) < \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{deg}_H(V_H)$. It follows that for every $i$ from $1$ to $k$, $\\mathrm{deg}_H(C_i) < \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{deg}_H(V_H)$. By Proposition 44, we can deduce that $|E'| \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\alpha \\mathrm{deg}_H(C_i) = \\alpha|E_H|$. This contradicts the given condition $|E'| \\le \\theta|E_H| \\le \\alpha|E_H|$. Thus, this case cannot happen.\n**Case 2.** Suppose that $\\mathrm{deg}_H(C_1) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{deg}_H(V_H)$. This implies that the total degree of the union of all other components, $\\mathrm{deg}_H(C_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup C_k)$, is at most $\\mathrm{deg}_H(V_H)/2$. We can therefore apply the expansion property to obtain the inequality:\n$$|E'| \\ge \\alpha \\mathrm{deg}_H(C_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup C_k) = \\alpha(\\mathrm{deg}_H(V_H) - \\mathrm{deg}_H(C_1))$$\nBy rearranging this expression, we find that $\\mathrm{deg}_H(C_1) \\ge \\mathrm{deg}_H(V_H) - |E'|/\\alpha$, which in turn implies the lower bound $\\mathrm{deg}_H(C_1) \\ge (1 - \\frac{\\theta}{\\alpha}) \\mathrm{deg}_H(V_H)$.\n\nGiven that the kernel is a $\\frac{1}{144}$-total-degree expander with high probability, we are able to apply the preceding lemma to it. By leveraging the fact that the number of edges in the core is very close to the number of edges in the kernel, we can establish Lemma 12.\n\nLet us define $E'_K$ as the set of kernel edges for which the corresponding induced path in $G$ contains one or more edges from $E'$. Observe that this construction ensures that the size of this new set is no larger than the original, that is, $|E'_K| \\le |E'|$. From Lemma 40, we also have the relation $|E_c| \\le (1 + e^{-d/3})|E_K|$. Consequently, we can bound the size of $E'_K$ as follows:\n$$|E'_K| \\le \\frac{|E_K|}{144} (2\\theta - 2e^{-d/3})(1 + e^{-d/3}) < \\frac{|E_K|}{144}.$$\nIt is worth noting that for a sufficiently large $d$, the inequality $\\frac{1}{100} \\le 2e^{-d/3}$ holds, which leads to the bound $|E'| \\le \\frac{|E_c|}{144}(2\\theta - 2e^{-d/3})$. Therefore, we can apply Lemma 45, which establishes that the graph $(V_K, E_K \\setminus E'_K)$ has a giant component with a total degree of at least\n$$(1 - (\\theta - e^{-d/3})(1+e^{-d/3})) \\mathrm{deg}_K(V_K).$$\nThis can be further bounded below by\n$$\\frac{1 - (\\theta - e^{-d/3})(1+e^{-d/3})}{1+e^{-d/3}} \\mathrm{degg}(V_c),$$\nwhich is greater than or equal to $(1-\\theta)\\mathrm{degg}(V_c)$.\nTo complete the proof, we observe that the vertices of this giant component in the kernel are necessarily connected within the same component of the graph $(V_c, E_c \\setminus E')$. Furthermore, their degrees are not smaller in this graph. This implies the existence of a component in $(V_c, E_c \\setminus E')$ with a total degree of at least $(1-\\theta)\\mathrm{degg}(V_c)$, which proves the lemma.",
