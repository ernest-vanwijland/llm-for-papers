  "proof": "We can begin by noting that it is sufficient to prove the statement for any connected set with a total degree of at most $\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{deg}_K(G_K)$. If the number of edges in the cut for such sets is at least a $\\frac{1}{144}$-fraction of their total degree, the result for an arbitrary vertex set can be obtained by combining the outcomes for its individual connected components.\n\nAccording to Lemma 38, with high probability (whp), the number of vertices in the kernel satisfies $n_K \\ge n(1 - e^{-d/3})$, which in turn implies that whp $\\log^2 n_K \\ge \\log n$. Consequently, by the contiguity of $K(n, d)$ and Lemma 42, it holds whp that for any set $S_K$ with $|S_K| \\le \\log n$, we have $|E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})| \\ge \\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K)/144$. We also assume that $d$ is sufficiently large for the whp results of Proposition 10 (with $\\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{10}$), Proposition 11, and Proposition 35 (with $\\xi = 2/3$) to hold. In the following, we assume that our graph $G$ possesses the properties guaranteed by these results.\n\nLet $S_G \\subseteq V_G$ be the set defined in Observation 43. The proof is structured into four cases, categorized by the sizes of $S_K$ and $S_G$.\n\n1.  If the size of the set is $|S_K| \\le \\log n$, then Lemma 42 directly gives the required inequality: $|E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})| \\ge \\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K)/144$.\n\n2.  If the sizes of the sets satisfy $\\log n \\le |S_K| \\le |S_G| \\le \\frac{n}{6}$ (we note that the middle inequality is always true), then an application of Proposition 11 and the aforementioned observation yields\n    $$|E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})| = |E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})| \\ge \\frac{3}{5} \\mathrm{deg}_G(S_G) \\ge \\frac{3}{5} \\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K),$$\n    where the last inequality is a consequence of the fact that $\\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K) \\le \\mathrm{deg}_G(S_G)$.\n\n3.  If the size of $S_G$ is in the range $\\frac{n}{6} < |S_G| \\le \\frac{2n}{3}$, Lemma 35 provides the bound $e_G(S_G) \\le (\\frac{2}{9}d + 1)|S_G|$, and Proposition 10 gives $\\mathrm{deg}_G(S_G) \\ge \\frac{9d}{10}|S_G|$. Therefore,\n    $$ \\frac{|E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})|}{\\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K)} \\ge \\frac{|E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})|}{\\mathrm{deg}_G(S_G)} = 1 - \\frac{2e_G(S_G)}{\\mathrm{deg}_G(S_G)} \\ge 1 - \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{10}{9d}. $$\n    The first inequality in this sequence is due to $\\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K) \\le \\mathrm{deg}_G(S_G)$, and the second is derived from the bounds mentioned above. For all sufficiently large $d$, this expression is at least $\\frac{1}{10}$.\n\n4.  Finally, we must exclude the possibility that $|S_G| \\ge \\frac{2n}{3}$.\n    From Proposition 41, we have $\\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K) \\ge (1 - d^{-1/3})d|S_G| - 2dne^{-d^{1/3}}$. For large enough $d$, this is at least $nd[\\frac{1}{3} - d^{-1/3} - 2e^{-d^{1/3}}] \\ge 2dn/3$. However, we also know that (whp) $|E_K| \\le |E_G| \\le nd/2 + o(n)$. This means that for any such set $S_K$, its degree $\\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K)$ would be greater than $\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{deg}_K(G_K)$, which contradicts the initial condition on $S_K$. Consequently, we can rule out this case.",
