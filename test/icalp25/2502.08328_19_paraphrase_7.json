  "proof": "Proof. According to the model from Proposition 36, we have $\\Delta \\sim N(d - \\mu, 1/n)$. By using the inequality $\\mu \\le e^{-d/2}$ from the preceding lemma, it follows that with high probability, $\\Delta \\ge d - e^{-d/2}$. We then note that the number of vertices not in the 2-core can be expressed as $n - n_K = \\sum_i 1\\{D_i < 3\\}$. Although the degrees $D_i$ are conditioned on their sum being even, the probability of this event is bounded below by a constant. Thus, it is sufficient to show that the sum of $n$ i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables, each with parameter $P(\\text{Poisson}(\\Delta) < 3)$, is at most $ne^{-d/3}$ with high probability. With high probability, on the event that $\\Delta \\ge d - e^{-d/2}$, the mean of these variables is bounded above by $ne^{-d-e^{-d/2}}(1+d-e^{-d/2} + (d-e^{-d/2})^2/2)$. It can be verified that for all $d \\ge 4$, there is a positive constant $\\delta(d)$, which is independent of $n$, such that this mean is less than or equal to $ne^{-d/3} - n\\delta$. By applying standard Chernoff bounds, this implies that $n - n_K \\le ne^{-d/3}$ with high probability, and the result follows. The remainder of the lemma is a consequence of the contiguity of $K(n,d)$, as stated in Proposition 36, and the fact that $n_K \\le n_C$.",
