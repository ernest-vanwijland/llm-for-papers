  "proof": "Proof. Let $P := \\{v \\in V : \\text{deg}(v) \\le b\\}$. Then, $Q := V \\setminus P$. This is clearly a partition, since each vertex is in exactly one of P or Q.\n\nWe will now prove the bound on $G[P]$. For every vertex $v \\in P$, $\\text{deg}(v) \\le b$ in $G$. Since $G[P]$ is a subgraph of $G$, $\\text{deg}(v) \\le b$ in $G[P]$ as well. Hence, $\\Delta(G[P]) \\le b$.\n\nNow for the bound on $|Q|$. It is known that the number of edges is equal to half the sum of the degrees. Since vertices in $Q$ have high degree and vertices in $P$ have low degree, the sum of degrees in $Q$ must be at least the sum of degrees in $P$. It follows that the total number of edges is bounded by the sum of degrees in $Q$. Hence, we have\n$$ m \\le \\sum_{v \\in V \\setminus P} \\text{deg}(v) > \\sum_{v \\in Q} b = |Q| \\cdot b. $$\nThen, we rearrange to get $|Q| < \\frac{m}{b}$.",
