  "proof": "Proof. Consider arbitrary $F \\in B_1$. As we saw in Case 0 of the proof of Lemma 53, the number of singleton components in $(V_c, F)$ is at most $(1 - \\frac{2\\eta}{3})n$. Let $S$ be the set of vertices that are in components of size $\\ge 2$.\nNote that the edges of $F$ have all endpoints in $S$, thus $|F| \\le e_G(S)$. Combining Lemmas 29, 30 (with $R$ being the $k$ from the previous lemma) and 35, we get for all $d$ large enough, whp, for any connected subset $S' \\subseteq S$ of $(V_c, F)$, $e_G(S') \\le |S'|(1+\\max(1, d\\eta/3))$. Hence, $e_G(S) \\le |S|(2+d\\eta/3)$. Since $e_G(S) \\ge |F| \\ge \\frac{9\\eta}{10}|E_c|$, we must have $|S| \\ge \\frac{9\\eta|E_c|}{10d(\\eta/3+2/d)}$. Since each component containing vertices from $S$ has at least 2 vertices, the number of components is reduced relative to the number of vertices. The number of components within $S$ is at most $|S|/2$, while the number of singletons is $n-|S|$. Thus, we can bound the total number of components by $c(F) \\le n+|S|/2$. Therefore we can bound\n$$\n\\frac{w_G(F)}{w_G(\\emptyset)} = q^{c(F)-n_c}(e^\\beta-1)^{|F|} \\le q^{n+\\frac{|S|}{2}-n_c}(e^\\beta-1)^{|F|} \\le q^{n+\\frac{9\\eta|E_c|}{20d(\\eta/3+2/d)}-n_c}(e^\\beta-1)^{|F|} \\le q^{\\frac{9\\eta|E_c|}{10d}(\\frac{1}{2(\\eta/3+2/d)}+21)}\n$$\nwhere the last inequality follows from $\\beta \\le \\beta_1$ and that whp $n_c \\ge n(1-e^{-d/3})$. For all $d$ large enough $\\frac{9}{2(\\eta/3+2/d)}+21 > 1$. By Lemma 39, whp $|E_c| \\ge \\frac{dn}{2}-2ne^{-d/3} \\ge \\frac{dn}{3}$, giving that $\\frac{w_G(F)}{Z_c^{\\mathrm{dis}}} \\le q^{n[\\eta/20+e^{-d/3}]}$. For all $d$ large enough, this is at most $q^{n\\eta/15}$. Aggregating over at most $2^{|E_c|} \\le 2^{dn}$ configurations $F$, we get that $\\pi_c^{\\mathrm{dis}}(B_1) \\le e^{-\\Omega(n)}$ for all $q$ large enough.",
