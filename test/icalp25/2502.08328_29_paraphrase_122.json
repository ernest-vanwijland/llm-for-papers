  "proof": "According to Lemmas 47 and 35, a constant $A > 0$ exists such that for all sufficiently large $d$, the graph $G$ will, with high probability, satisfy two properties for all $\\beta \\in (0, \\beta_1]$. First, any polymer $\\gamma$ with a vertex count of at least $\\frac{A \\log n}{d}$ will have a weight of at most $q^{1-|V_G(\\gamma)|/10}$. Second, any connected vertex set $S \\subseteq V_C$ with a size of at least $\\frac{A \\log n}{d}$ will have at most $e_G(S) \\le (2d/3+1)|S|$ edges. Additionally, by applying the union bound and Markov's inequality to Lemma 31, it holds with high probability that for every $s$ where $1 \\le s \\le n$, there are at most $n^{5/2}(ed)^s$ connected subsets of size $s$. In what follows, we assume that $G$ satisfies these properties. Based on the previous lemma and the union bound, it is sufficient to show that\n$$ \\sum_{\\substack{\\gamma \\in \\bigcup_{F \\in \\Omega^{\\mathrm{dis}}} \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{dis}} \\\\ |V_G(\\gamma)| \\ge A \\log n/d}} w^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma) \\le q^{-A \\log n/(25d)}. $$\nFor any connected subset $S$ of size at least $\\frac{A \\log n}{d}$, we have $e_G(S) \\le (2d/3+1)|S|$. This implies that there are at most $2^{(2d/3+1)|S|}$ possible connected subgraphs of $G$ on the vertex set $S$. Consequently, the number of polymers with $s \\ge \\frac{A \\log n}{d}$ vertices is bounded above by $n^{5/2}(ed)^s 2^{(2d/3+1)s}$. From Lemma 47, for any polymer with $s \\ge \\frac{A \\log n}{d}$ vertices, its weight is at most $q^{1-s/10}$. Therefore, by summing over all possible sizes, we can bound the total sum by\n$$ \\sum_{s \\ge (A/d) \\log n} n^{5/2}(ed)^s 2^{(2d/3+1)s} q^{1-s/10} = q n^{5/2} \\sum_{s \\ge (A/d) \\log n} [2^{2d/3+1} ed q^{-1/10}]^s. $$\nFinally, if $q$ is sufficiently large, we have $2^{2d/3+1}edq^{-1/10} < q^{-1/20}$. For a large enough $q$, the sum can then be bounded by $O(n^{5/2}q^{-A \\log n/(20d)})$, which is less than or equal to $q^{-A \\log n/(25d)}$.",
