  "proof": "Let us consider a configuration $F \\in \\Omega_C^{\\mathrm{dis}}$. For such a configuration, its size is bounded by $|F| \\le \\eta|E_C|$, which implies that its weight is bounded by $w_C(F) \\le q^{n_C} (e^\\beta - 1)^{\\eta|E_C|}$. The cardinality of the set $\\Omega_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}$ is at most $|\\Omega_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}| \\le 2^{|E_C|}$, and because $F = E_C$ is a valid configuration, we can establish a lower bound for the partition function, $Z_C \\ge q(e^\\beta-1)^{|E_C|}$. With high probability, the number of edges satisfies $|E_C| \\le \\frac{dn}{2} + \\eta n$, and therefore $|\\Omega_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}| \\le 2^{n(d/2+\\eta)}$. By combining these inequalities and using the condition that $\\beta \\ge \\beta_1$, we can bound the ratio as follows:\n$$\n\\frac{Z_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}}{Z_C} \\le \\frac{2^{(d/2+\\eta)n}q^{n_C}(e^\\beta - 1)^{-(1-\\eta)|E_C|}}{q} \\le q^{n-(1-\\eta)(2+1/10)|E_C|}.\n$$\nFrom Lemma 39, we have the high-probability lower bound $|E_C| \\ge \\frac{dn}{2} - 2ne^{-d/3}$. Substituting this into our expression yields:\n$$\n\\frac{Z_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}}{Z_C} \\le q^{n[1-(1-\\eta)(2+1/10)(d/2-2e^{-d/3})/d]} \\le q^{-n[1/20-2\\eta+5e^{-d/3}/d]}\n$$\nDue to the choice of $\\eta$, this expression is at most $q^{-n/40}$ for all sufficiently large $d$. Consequently, for any sufficiently large $q$, the ratio is at most $e^{-n}$.",
