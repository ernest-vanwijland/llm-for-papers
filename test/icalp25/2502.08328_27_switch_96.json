  "proof": "Let $k = |V_G(\\gamma)|$. By construction, the subgraph of $G$ induced on $V_G(\\gamma)$ is connected. Hence, this subgraph has at least $k-1$ edges. As $\\beta < \\beta_1$, we have $\\zeta(\\beta) > \\xi(\\beta)$. Therefore, Fact 4.4 yields\n$$ w^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma) \\le \\exp(k \\cdot \\xi(\\beta) - (k-1) \\cdot \\zeta(\\beta)). $$\nThus, there is a constant $c = c(\\beta) > 0$ such that\n$$ w^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma) \\le \\exp(-ck). $$\nThe assertion follows for sufficiently large $A$ because $k \\ge A \\log n/d$.",
