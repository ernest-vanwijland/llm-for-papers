  "proof": "We begin by fixing $\\tau$. Let $h_t$ denote the number of edges from the set $\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)$ that have arrived by time $t$. Our first step is to claim that at any time $t$, any edge $e \\in \\text{LOW}(\\tau)$ is positioned at most $\\tau + h_t$ slots ahead of its final, true position. This can be written as $\\text{index}_t(e) - \\text{index}(e) \\le \\tau + h_t$. This statement is true at $t=0$ by definition.\n\nTo prove the claim, we will use a proof by contradiction. Let us assume there is a first time $t$ where this condition is violated for some edge $e$. This implies that the condition held at the previous time step, $\\text{index}_{t-1}(e) - \\text{index}(e) \\le \\tau + h_{t-1}$, but fails at time $t$, so $\\text{index}_t(e) - \\text{index}(e) > \\tau + h_t$. We should observe that an edge's predicted position can increase by at most 1 at each time step. Therefore, the violation could only have occurred if $\\text{index}_t(e) = \\text{index}_{t-1}(e) + 1$ and $h_t = h_{t-1}$. The latter condition, $h_t = h_{t-1}$, means that the edge $e'$ inserted at time $t$ must be in $\\text{LOW}(\\tau)$.\n\nThe insertion of $e'$ caused the position of $e$ to change, which means $e'$ must have jumped from a position greater than $\\text{index}_{t-1}(e)$ to its arrival position $t$. This gives us $\\text{index}_{t-1}(e') > \\text{index}_{t-1}(e)$. It is also important to note that because $e'$ jumped over $e$ in the list of predictions, edge $e$ cannot have arrived yet. Thus, its true arrival time is after $t$, which is the arrival time of $e'$, so $\\text{index}(e) > t = \\text{index}(e')$. From this, we can deduce the following:\n$$ \\text{index}_{t-1}(e') - \\text{index}(e') > \\text{index}_{t-1}(e) - \\text{index}(e)+2 = \\text{index}_t(e) - \\text{index}(e)+1 > \\tau + h_t = \\tau + h_{t-1}. $$\nThis inequality shows a violation of the condition for edge $e'$ at time $t-1$, which contradicts our assumption that $t$ was the first time such a violation happened.\n\nNow, let us fix a position $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$. At any given time $t$, there are two possibilities: either no jump occurs, or an edge jumps from a position $t' > t$ to position $t$. Let's consider $t^*$ to be the first time that an edge $e \\in \\text{LOW}(\\tau)$ jumps over position $i$. We aim to show that $t^*$ cannot be substantially smaller than $i$. For this to be a jump over $i$, the edge must have jumped from a position $t' > i$ to a position $t^* < i$. This implies that the predicted position of $e$ at time $t^* - 1$ was $t'$, so $\\text{index}_{t^*-1}(e) = t'$. The actual arrival position of $e$ is $t^*$, so $\\text{index}(e) = t^*$. Using the claim we just proved, we have:\n$$ t' - t^* = \\text{index}_{t^*-1}(e) - \\text{index}(e) \\le \\tau + h_{t^*-1} \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|. $$\nThis implies that $i - t^* < t' - t^* \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n\nBefore time $t^*$, any edges that could have jumped over position $i$ must be in the set $\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)$. Consequently, there are at most $|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$ jumps over $i$ before time $t^*$. Furthermore, no edge can jump over position $i$ after time $i$. Therefore, the total count of jumps over $i$ is bounded by the sum of jumps before $t^*$ and the jumps that can occur between $t^*$ and $i$, which is at most $|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)| + (i - t^* + 1)$. Using our previous inequality, this is less than or equal to $\\tau + 2|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.",
