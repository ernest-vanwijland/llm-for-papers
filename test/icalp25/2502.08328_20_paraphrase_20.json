  "proof": "We know that $\\Delta$ is distributed as $N(d - \\mu, 1/n)$, which implies that with high probability, $d - \\mu - \\frac{1}{2}e^{-d/3} < \\Delta$. For any $d \\ge 3$, we have the bound $\\mu \\le e^{-d/2} < e^{-d/3}$, and from this it follows that $\\Delta > d - \\frac{3}{2}e^{-d/3}$.\n\nFrom a previous lemma, it is established that with high probability, $n-n_K \\le ne^{-d/3}$. Additionally, we can state the inequality $2|E_K| \\ge \\sum^n D_i - 2(n-n_K)$. Therefore, it becomes sufficient to demonstrate that with high probability, $\\sum^n D_i \\ge n(d-2e^{-d/3})$. Because the probability that $\\sum D_i$ is an even number is bounded from below by a constant, this is equivalent to showing that with high probability, a Poisson random variable with mean $\\Delta n$ satisfies $\\text{Poisson}(\\Delta n) \\ge n(d-2e^{-d/3})$.\n\nSince we have established that $\\Delta \\ge d - \\frac{3}{2}e^{-d/3}$ with high probability, it follows from relation (9) that the probability of the complementary event is exponentially small, i.e., $P(\\text{Poisson}(\\Delta n) \\le n(d-2e^{-d/3})) = e^{-\\Omega(n)})$. The claim for the $G(n, d/n)$ model is then a consequence of the contiguity of $K(n, d)$.",
