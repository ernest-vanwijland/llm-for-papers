  "proof": "Proof. Suppose a deterministic algorithm exists. Then, by Lemma 2.3, there is a set of $k = [\\ln n]+1$ players that can solve the INDEPENDENT-SET($n, \\Delta, k, s$) problem with the same independent set size. However, by Lemma 4.5, this is impossible. After all, if Player $k$ outputs an independent set of size greater than $\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$, then we can find another set of edges to send such that each player sends the same message but the independent set is no longer valid.",
