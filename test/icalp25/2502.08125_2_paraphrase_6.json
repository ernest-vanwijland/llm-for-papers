  "proof": "We first observe that if $t=m$, the premise of the statement is false, as a vertex $v$ cannot be dead at the final time step. Let us then consider the case where $1 \\le t \\le m-1$. In this scenario, $t$ is the midpoint of a recursive subproblem on an interval $[l, r]$ with $r-l \\ge 2$, which implies that $l < t$. If we assume that $v$ is dead at time $t$, then by definition, its distance estimate is the same as it was at the start of the subproblem, which means $\\tilde{d}^l(v) = \\tilde{d}^t(v)$. If $l$ is equal to $t-1$, our claim is already proven. Otherwise, it must be that $t-1$ is in the interval $(l, t)$. As a result, $t-1$ acts as the midpoint for a descendant subproblem of $[l, t]$ within the recursion tree. Because $v$ is also dead during these subsequent recursive calls, we have $\\tilde{d}^{t-1}(v) = \\tilde{d}^l(v)$. By combining these equalities, we arrive at the conclusion that $\\tilde{d}^{t-1}(v) = \\tilde{d}^l(v) = \\tilde{d}^t(v)$.",
