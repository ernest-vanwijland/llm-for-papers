  "proof": "We begin by selecting a constant $A > 0$. Since any connected set of vertices in $G$ contains a spanning subtree on those same vertices, our task reduces to showing that the expected number of \"bad\" subtrees is negligible. Specifically, we will show that the expected number of subtrees $T$ in $G$ that have at least $\\frac{A \\log n}{d}$ vertices and an average degree less than $(1-\\varepsilon)d$ is $o(1)$. This can be formulated as proving\n$$ \\sum_{\\substack{T \\text{ a possible subtree of } G \\\\ |V_G(T)| \\ge A \\log n/d}} \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}\\{T \\text{ is a subtree of } G \\text{ and } \\text{degg}(T) \\ge (1-\\varepsilon)d|V_G(T)|\\}] = o(1). $$\nThe lemma will then follow from an application of Markov's inequality.\n\nLet us fix a potential tree $T$ with $s = |V_G(T)|$ vertices. The expectation for this specific tree within the sum can be factored as\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}\\{T \\text{ a subtree of } G\\}] \\mathbb{P}(\\text{degg}(T) < (1-\\varepsilon)ds \\mid T \\text{ a subtree of } G). $$\nConditioned on the event that $T$ is a subtree of $G$, the sum of the degrees of its vertices, $\\text{degg}(T)$, is equal to $2e_G(T) + |E_G(V_G(T), \\overline{V_G(T)})|$. This sum is therefore bounded below by the size of the edge cut, $|E_G(V_G(T), \\overline{V_G(T)})|$, which is a random variable distributed as $\\text{Bin}(s(n-s), d/n)$. Given that $s \\le \\xi n$, we have $n-s > n(1-\\xi)$, which implies that this binomial distribution is stochastically dominated by $\\text{Bin}(sn(1-\\xi), d/n)$.\n\nConsequently, the conditional probability $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{deg}_G(T) < (1-\\varepsilon)ds \\mid T \\text{ a subtree of } G)$ is at most\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Bin}(s(1-\\xi)n, d/n) \\le (1-\\varepsilon)ds). $$\nBy applying a Chernoff bound, we find this probability is at most $\\exp\\{-\\frac{ds(\\varepsilon-\\xi)^2}{2(1-\\xi)}\\}$.\n\nNext, we sum over all possible sizes $s$ from $\\frac{A \\log n}{d}$ up to $\\xi n$. Using Lemma 31 to bound the expected number of subtrees of a given size, we can bound the total expected number of subtrees in $G$ with size $s$ in the range $\\frac{A \\log n}{d} \\le s \\le \\xi n$ and average degree less than $(1-\\varepsilon)d$. This expected number is bounded above by\n$$ \\sum_{s=\\frac{A \\log n}{d}}^{\\xi n} \\mathbb{E}[\\#\\text{subtrees of } G \\text{ with } s \\text{ vertices}] \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{ds(\\varepsilon-\\xi)^2}{2(1-\\xi)}\\right\\} \\le \\sum_{s=\\frac{A \\log n}{d}}^{\\xi n} n(ed)^s \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{ds(\\varepsilon-\\xi)^2}{2(1-\\xi)}\\right\\}. $$\nFor all sufficiently large $d$, the inequality $\\frac{d(\\varepsilon-\\xi)^2}{2(1-\\xi)} - 1 - \\log d > \\frac{d(\\varepsilon-\\xi)^2}{3(1-\\xi)}$ is satisfied. As a result, the sum is\n$$ O\\left(\\exp\\left\\{\\log n \\left[1 - \\frac{A(\\varepsilon-\\xi)^2}{3(1-\\xi)}\\right]\\right\\}\\right). $$\nIf we choose any $A > \\frac{3(1-\\xi)}{(\\varepsilon-\\xi)^2}$, the expression inside the square brackets becomes negative, making the entire term $o(1)$. This concludes the proof of the lemma.",
