  "proof": "Proof. By Proposition 10 and Lemma 35, there exists a real $A > 0$ such that for all $d$ large enough, whp, any connected set $|S|$ with size at least $A\\log(n)/d$ has $\\mathrm{degg}(S) > \\frac{9d}{10}|S|$, and if furthermore $|S| \\le \\frac{n}{6}$, then $e_G(S) \\le (1+\\frac{1}{5})|S|$.\nSince $\\mathrm{degg}(S) = 2e_G(S) + |E_G(S,S^c)|$, we can rearrange to get the ratio of internal edges, $\\frac{2e_G(S)}{\\mathrm{degg}(S)} = 1 + \\frac{|E_G(S,S^c)|}{\\mathrm{degg}(S)}$. Using the inequalities, we can bound the term on the right. For any connected set $S$, $|E_G(S,S^c)| \\ge 1$, and for $d$ large enough $\\mathrm{degg}(S)$ is positive, so we have\n$$\n\\frac{e_G(S)}{\\mathrm{degg}(S)} \\ge \\frac{3}{5}.\n$$\nFor all $d$ large enough, this is at most $\\frac{3}{5}$. To finish the proof, note that whenever $|S| \\ge \\frac{n}{6}$, its total degree is at least $\\frac{3dn}{10}$. But whp $\\frac{3nd}{10} > |E_G| > |E_c|$, giving $\\frac{\\mathrm{degg}(V_c)}{10} < \\frac{3nd}{10} < \\mathrm{degg}(S)$. Thus whenever $S$ has $\\mathrm{degg}(S) \\le \\mathrm{degg}(V_c)/10$, then also $|S| \\le n/6$, thus the exansion applies.",
