  "proof": "Proof. For any given set $S$ with size $\\xi n \\le |S| \\le (1-\\xi)n$, $\\text{deg}_G(S)$ is a sum of independent $2\\text{Bin}(\\binom{|S|}{2}, d/n)$ and $\\text{Bin}(|S|(n-|S|), d/n)$ random variables, corresponding to inner edges, and edges going outside of $S$ respectively.\nFirst we bound $P(2\\text{Bin}(\\binom{|S|}{2}, d/n) < (1-\\varepsilon)d|S|^2/n)$. By Chernoff, for $n$ large enough so that $(1-\\varepsilon)/(|S|-1) < \\varepsilon/2$ and $1/n < \\xi/2$, this is at most $\\exp\\{-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2n/32\\}$.\nThen for the proportion of the degree corresponding to the edges of going from $S$ to $\\bar{S}$, this is $\\sim \\text{Bin}(|S|(n-|S|), d/n)$, and by Chernoff $P(\\text{Bin}(|S|(n-|S|), d/n) < (1-\\varepsilon) d|S|(n-|S|)/n) \\le \\exp\\{-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2n/2\\}$.\nHence by union bound, there is such a set with average degree $< (1-\\varepsilon)d$ with probability at most $\\exp\\{-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2n/2\\}+\\exp\\{-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2(n-1)/32\\}$. There are at most $2^n$ such sets $S$, thus by another union bound and by the condition on $d$, we obtain that the probability of a large set of small average degree existing is at most $\\exp\\{-\\Omega(n)\\} = o(1)$.",
