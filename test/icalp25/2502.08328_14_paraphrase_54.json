  "proof": "For any vertex set $S$ of size $\\xi n \\le |S| \\le (1-\\xi)n$, the sum of degrees within the set, $\\text{degg}(S)$, is composed of two independent parts: the contribution from edges within $S$, distributed as $2\\text{Bin}(\\binom{|S|}{2}, d/n)$, and the contribution from edges between $S$ and its complement, distributed as $\\text{Bin}(|S|(n-|S|), d/n)$.\n\nWe first bound the probability for the internal degree component: $P(2\\text{Bin}(\\binom{|S|}{2}, d/n) < (1-\\varepsilon)d|S|^2/n)$. For sufficiently large $n$ (such that $(1-\\varepsilon)/(|S|-1) < \\varepsilon/2$ and $1/n < \\xi/2$), the Chernoff bound gives an upper limit of $\\exp\\{-\\frac{d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2 n}{32}\\}$ for this probability.\n\nSimilarly, for the degree component from edges connecting $S$ to $\\bar{S}$, which follows a $\\text{Bin}(|S|(n-|S|), d/n)$ distribution, a Chernoff bound shows that $P(\\text{Bin}(|S|(n-|S|), d/n) < (1-\\varepsilon)\\frac{d|S|(n-|S|)}{n}) \\le \\exp\\{-\\frac{d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2 n}{2}\\}$.\n\nIf the average degree of $S$ is less than $(1-\\varepsilon)d$, then at least one of the two aforementioned unlikely events must occur. By the union bound, the probability of this happening for a fixed set $S$ is therefore at most $\\exp\\{-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2n/2\\} + \\exp\\{-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2n/32\\}$. To account for all possible sets $S$, we apply another union bound. Since there are at most $2^n$ such sets, the probability that any set with the given size constraints has a small average degree is, by the condition on $d$, bounded by $\\exp\\{-\\Omega(n)\\}$, which is $o(1)$.",
