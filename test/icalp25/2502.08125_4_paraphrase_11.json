  "proof": "Proof. The proof proceeds by induction on $t$. The case where $t=0$ is trivial.\nSuppose that $v_i$ is dead in $G_{t'}$ for all $t' \\in \\text{rebuild}(t)$ with $t' \\le t$. Then $v_i$ is also dead at time $t$, since by definition $t \\in \\text{rebuild}(t)$. Under this condition, $D[i]$ is not modified at time $t$. By Lemma 3 and the induction hypothesis, it follows that $D[i] = \\tilde{d}^{t-1}(v_i) = \\tilde{d}^t(v_i)$.\nIn the other case, let $t'$ be the maximum time less than or equal to $t$ in $\\text{rebuild}(t)$ for which $v_i$ is alive. The algorithm is defined such that $D[i] = \\tilde{d}^{t'}(v_i)$. If $t' = t$, then it follows that $D[i] = \\tilde{d}^t(v_i)$. If $t' < t$, then by applying Lemma 3 repeatedly, we have $\\tilde{d}^t(v_i) = \\tilde{d}^{t'}(v_i)$.",
