  "proof": "Let us consider an arbitrary edge $e$ in the cut $E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})$. This edge must correspond to a kernel edge $e' = \\{v, w\\} \\in E_K$, as $e$ must lie on a path corresponding to $e'$. We can be sure that $e$ is not an edge leading to an attached tree, since by definition, all edges within a tree attached to a vertex from $S_K$ are contained in $S_G$. One of the endpoints of $e$ must be a kernel vertex, which is also an endpoint of $e'$; let us call this vertex $v$ and assume $v \\in S_K$. If we suppose for contradiction that $e' \\notin E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})$, then it must be that both $v$ and $w$ are in $S_K$. This would mean that all vertices on the path corresponding to $e'$ are in $S_G$, which in turn implies that $e \\notin E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})$. This is a contradiction. Thus, it must be that $e' \\in E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})$.\n\nFurthermore, it is not possible for two distinct edges $e_1 \\neq e_2 \\in E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})$ to have the same corresponding kernel edge. Since $S_G$ represents $S_K$ in $C$, both $e_1$ and $e_2$ must have an endpoint that is a kernel vertex in $S_K$. These endpoints cannot be identical, because if they were, $e_1$ and $e_2$ would be the same edge, as they are on a single induced path. Therefore, they must be at opposite ends of the maximal induced path. But if that were the case, both endpoints of the path would be in $S_K$, implying all vertices on this path are in $S_G$. This contradicts the premise that $e_1$ and $e_2$ are in the cut. Consequently, the correspondence is one-to-one, and we have $|E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})| \\ge |E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})|$.\n\nTo show the converse, let's take an edge $e \\in E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})$, where $e = \\{v, w\\}$ and $v \\in S_K$. The first edge $e'$ on the induced path in $G$ that corresponds to $e$ and originates from $v$ is an element of $E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})$. This creates a mapping from $e$ to $e'$, which is an injection because it possesses a unique inverse (the process of contracting a maximal induced path yields a unique vertex set).",
