  "proof": "Proof. Assume we have some $A > 0$ for now. We use Markov inequality on the expected number of subtrees of $G$, $T$ with $\\frac{A \\log n}{d} < |V_G(T)| \\le \\xi n$ (as every connected set has a spanning tree). Thus it is enough to show\n$$ \\sum_{\\substack{T \\text{ a tree} \\\\ \\frac{A \\log n}{d} < |V_G(T)| \\le \\xi n}} P(e_G(V_G(T)) \\ge (\\xi d + 1)|V_G(T)| | T \\text{ a subtree of } G)P(T \\text{ a subtree of } G) = o(1) $$\nBy Lemma 31, the expected number of subtrees of size $s$ is at most $n(ed)^s$.\nFix a tree $T$ with $s$ vertices. Then conditional on $T$ being a subgraph of $G$, $e_G(V(T)) \\sim s-1 + \\text{Bin}(\\binom{s}{2} - (s-1), d/n)$. Since $\\binom{s}{2} - s - 1 < s^2/2$, we can bound\n$$ P(e_G(V_G(T)) \\ge (2\\xi d/3 + 1)s | T \\text{ a subtree of } G) \\le P(\\text{Bin}(s^2/2, d/n) \\ge 2\\xi ds/3). $$\nNoting that $s < \\xi n$, Chernoff bound gives that this is at most $\\exp\\{-\\xi ds/216\\}$.\nHence summing over possible subtree sizes, we get that the expected number of \"bad\" subtrees is at most\n$$ \\sum_{\\frac{A \\log n}{d} < s \\le \\xi n} n[de^{1+\\xi d/216}]^s. $$\nFor all $d$ large enough, $de^{1+\\xi d/216} < \\exp\\{-\\xi d/250\\}$, and thus then the sum is $O(n^{1-A\\xi/250})$, which is $o(1)$ for any $A > \\frac{250}{\\xi}$.",
