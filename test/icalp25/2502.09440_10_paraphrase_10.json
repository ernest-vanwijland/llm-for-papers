  "proof": "We proceed by contradiction and assume that such a deterministic algorithm exists. From Lemma 2.3, the existence of this algorithm implies that a set of $k = [\\ln n]+1$ players can solve the INDEPENDENT-SET($n, \\Delta, k, s$) problem and achieve an independent set of the same size. This scenario, however, is impossible according to Lemma 4.5. The reason is that if Player $k$ were to output an independent set with a size exceeding $\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2} + \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2} \\cdot k \\cdot (96\\ell^2 \\ln(n) + 30)$, it would be possible to define a different set of edges for which every player sends the exact same message, but the resulting output is no longer a valid independent set.",
