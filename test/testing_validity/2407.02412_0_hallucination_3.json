Hence $\\mathrm{dist}_{H_n}(b, t) \\geq n$, because there are $n$ copies of the interior gadget $I$.\nFor the proof of 2, the three gadgets are $k$-leaf powers and, therefore, are strongly chordal. The construction of $H_n$ does not introduce additional cycles; thus, $H_n$ remains strongly chordal.\nTo prove 3, we combine the leaf-root properties provided by the gadgets $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$, $T_I$, and $R_I$, as illustrated in Figure 2.\n\nThe left tree in Figure 2 is obtained by merging $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ with $n$ copies of $T_I$, denoted as $T_I^1, \\dots, T_I^n$. We identify $t$ with $t_I^1$, and we identify the of $t$ in $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ with $t_I^1$ and with the parent of $t_I^1$ in $T_I^1$. Similarly, for all $j \\leq n - 1$, we identify $b_I^j$ and its parent with $t_I^{j+1}$ and its parent, respectively. We now prove that the resulting tree is a $k$-leaf root of $H_n - \\mathrm{Top}$. Top and each copy of the interior gadget $I$ are the $k$-leaf power of the corresponding subtree: $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ for Top and $T_I^j$ for the $j$-th copy of $I$. It remains to show that we do not introduce any additional, unwanted edges. If $v_1$ is a leaf of $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ different from $t$, and $v_2$ is a leaf of $T_I^j$ different from $t_I^j$ then, using Lemma 2.1, we conclude $d(v_1, t) \\geq m_{T_{\\mathrm{Top}}}(t) = 3$. Furthermore, using the second point of Lemma 2.3, we conclude $d(v_2,t_I^j) \\geq m_{T_I}(t_I) = k$. Therefore, $d(v_1, v_2) \\geq d(v_1,t) + d(v_2,t_I^j) - 2 \\geq k + 3 - 2 = k + 1 > k$, and there is no edge between $v_1$ and $v_2$ in the $k$-th power of the tree. Similarly, if $v_1$ is a leaf of $T_I^j$ different from $b_I^j$ for some $j < n-1$ and $v_2$ is a leaf of $T_I^{j+1}$ different from $t_I^{j+1}$, we have $d(v_1, b_I^j) \\geq 3$ and $d(v_2, t_I^{j+1}) \\geq k$. Thus, $d(v_1, v_2) \\geq d(v_1, b_I^j) + d(v_2, t_I^{j+1}) - 2 \\geq k + 3 - 2 = k + 1 > k$, and there is no edge between $v_1$ and $v_2$ in the $k$-th power of the tree.\n\nThe right tree in Figure 2 is formed by merging $n$ copies of $R_I$, denoted $R_I^1, \\dots, R_I^n$, with $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$. For all $j \\leq n - 1$, we identify $b_I^j$ with $t_I^{j+1}$, and we identify the parent of $b_I^j$ with the parent of $t_I^{j+1}$. Finally, we identify $b_I^n$ and its parent in $R_I^n$ with $b$ and its parent in $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$, respectively. Similar to the left tree, we must prove that no additional, unwanted edges are created. If $v_1$ is a leaf of $R_I^j$ different from $b_I^j$ for some $j < n - 1$ and $v_2$ is a leaf of $R_I^{j+1}$ different from $t_I^{j+1}$ then, using Lemma 2.3, we conclude $d(v_1, b_I^j) \\geq m_{R_I}(b_I) = 4$ and $d(v_2, t_I^{j+1}) \\geq m_{R_I}(t_I) = k - 1$. Thus, $d(v_1, v_2) \\geq d(v_1, b_I^j) + d(v_2, t_I^{j+1}) - 2 \\geq k-1+4-2 = k + 1 > k$, and there is no edge between $v_1$ and $v_2$ in the $k$-th power of the tree. Similarly if $v_1$ is a leaf of $R_I^n$ different from $b_I^n$ and $v_2$ is a leaf of $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$ different from $b$ then we have $d(v_1,b_I^n) \\geq 4$ and, using Lemma 2.2, $d(v_2, b) \\geq k - 1$. Therefore $d(v_1, v_2) \\geq d(v_1,b_I^n) + d(v_2, b) - 2 \\geq k + 1 > k$ and $v_1, v_2$ are not connected in the $k$-th power of the tree. This completes the proof of 3, the third point of the lemma.\n\nIt remains to prove 4, the final point of the lemma. We start by proving by induction that for any integer $n$, in any $k$-leaf root $T$ of $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$, there is a leaf at distance 3 of $b$ in $T$. When $n = 0$, there are no gadgets $I$ between Bot and Top, so $b = t$ and the property holds by property 1 of Lemma 2.1. Turning to the induction step, assume that the property holds for some $n \\geq 0$ and consider a $k$-leaf root $T$ of $H_{n+1} - \\mathrm{Bot}$. Since $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ is an induced subgraph of $H_{n+1} - \\mathrm{Bot}$, some induced subgraph of $T$ is a $k$-leaf root of $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a vertex $v_1$ in $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ at a distance exactly 3 from $b_I^n = t_I^{n+1}$ in an induced subgraph of $T$. Since distances in a tree are additive, it follows that $d(v_1,b_I^n) = 3$ in $T$. We claim that every vertex of $I^{n+1}$ is at distance at least $k$ from $b_I^n = t_I^{n+1}$ in $T$ (except $b_I^n$ itself). Assume, by contradiction, that there exists a vertex $v_2$ in the last copy $I^{n+1}$, distinct from $b_I^n$ such that that $d(v_2,b_I^n) \\leq k - 1$. This assumption would imply that $d(v_1, v_2) \\leq d(v_1, b_I^n) + d(v_2, b_I^n) - 2 \\leq 3 + (k - 1) - 2 = k$, meaning that $v_1$ and $v_2$ are connected in the $k$-th power of $T$, contradicting the fact that $T$ is a $k$-leaf root of $H_{n+1} - \\mathrm{Bot}$. Therefore, all vertices in $I^{n+1}$, distinct from $b_I^n$, are at a distance of at least $k$ from $b_I^n$ in $T$. We can now apply property 1 of Lemma 2.3, which concludes the induction.\n\nNow assume by contradiction that there exists a $k$-leaf root $T$ of $H_n$. $T$ induces a $k$-leaf root of $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$. In particular, there exists a vertex $v_1$ in $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ such that $d(b_I^n, v_1) = 3$. Moreover, property 1 of Lemma 2.2 implies that there exists a vertex $v_2$ in Bot, distinct from $b$, such that $d(v_2, b) \\leq k - 1$. Combining these equations, we get $d(v_1, v_2) \\leq k - 1 + 3 - 2 = k$, contradicting the fact that there is no edge between $v_1$ and $v_2$. This proves that $H_n$ is not a $k$-leaf power, as desired.",
