  "proof": "To prove the first property, observe that within the interior gadget $I$, the vertices $t_I$ and $b_I$ are distinct, so the distance between them is at least 1. Because the graph $H_n$ is constructed with $n$ such interior gadgets chained together, the distance between $b$ and $t$ must be at least $n$.\n\nFor the second property, we note that each of the three gadget types is a $k$-leaf power, and it is a known property that $k$-leaf powers are strongly chordal. The construction of $H_n$ by identifying vertices does not introduce any new cycles. Therefore, $H_n$ retains the strongly chordal property.\n\nTo demonstrate the third property, we construct the required $k$-leaf roots by combining the trees associated with the gadgets $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$, $T_I$, and $R_I$, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nThe tree on the left in Figure 2 is constructed by joining $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ with $n$ copies of $T_I$, which we will label $T_I^1, \\dots, T_I^n$. The vertex $t$ in $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ is identified with $t_I^1$ in $T_I^1$, and their respective parent nodes are also identified. In a similar fashion, for all $j \\leq n - 1$, the vertex $b_I^j$ and its parent in $T_I^j$ are identified with $t_I^{j+1}$ and its parent in $T_I^{j+1}$. We will now show that this composite tree is a $k$-leaf root for $H_n - \\mathrm{Top}$. The Top gadget and each interior gadget $I$ are known to be the $k$-leaf powers of their corresponding subtrees, namely $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ and $T_I^j$ for the $j$-th copy. We must now confirm that this composition does not create any additional, unintended edges. Consider a leaf $v_1$ of $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ other than $t$, and a leaf $v_2$ of $T_I^j$ other than $t_I^j$. By Lemma 2.1, we have $d(v_1, t) \\geq m_{T_{\\mathrm{Top}}}(t) = 3$. From the second point of Lemma 2.3, we have $d(v_2,t_I^j) \\geq m_{T_I}(t_I) = k$. The distance between $v_1$ and $v_2$ is thus bounded by $d(v_1, v_2) \\geq d(v_1,t) + d(v_2,t_I^j) - 2 \\geq 3 + k - 2 = k + 1$, which is greater than $k$. This means no edge is formed between $v_1$ and $v_2$ in the tree's $k$-th power. Similarly, for a leaf $v_1$ in $T_I^j$ (where $j < n-1$ and $v_1 \\neq b_I^j$) and a leaf $v_2$ in $T_I^{j+1}$ (where $v_2 \\neq t_I^{j+1}$), we have $d(v_1, b_I^j) \\geq 3$ and $d(v_2, t_I^{j+1}) \\geq k$. Their distance is therefore $d(v_1, v_2) \\geq d(v_1, b_I^j) + d(v_2, t_I^{j+1}) - 2 \\geq 3 + k - 2 = k + 1$, which is also greater than $k$, so no edge exists between them.\n\nThe tree on the right in Figure 2 is created by merging $n$ copies of $R_I$, which we will denote $R_I^1, \\dots, R_I^n$, with the tree $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$. For all $j$ up to $n-1$, we identify $b_I^j$ with $t_I^{j+1}$ and their parents with each other. Finally, $b_I^n$ and its parent in $R_I^n$ are identified with $b$ and its parent in $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$. As before, we must show that no unwanted edges are formed. If $v_1$ is a leaf of $R_I^j$ ($j < n - 1$) different from $b_I^j$, and $v_2$ is a leaf of $R_I^{j+1}$ different from $t_I^{j+1}$, then Lemma 2.3 gives us $d(v_1, b_I^j) \\geq m_{R_I}(b_I) = 4$ and $d(v_2, t_I^{j+1}) \\geq m_{R_I}(t_I) = k - 1$. The distance between them is $d(v_1, v_2) \\geq d(v_1, b_I^j) + d(v_2, t_I^{j+1}) - 2 \\geq 4 + (k-1) - 2 = k + 1$. This is greater than $k$, so no edge connects $v_1$ and $v_2$. In the same way, if $v_1$ is a leaf of $R_I^n$ other than $b_I^n$ and $v_2$ is a leaf of $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$ other than $b$, we find $d(v_1,b_I^n) \\geq 4$, and by Lemma 2.2, $d(v_2, b) \\geq k - 1$. This implies $d(v_1, v_2) \\geq d(v_1,b_I^n) + d(v_2, b) - 2 \\geq 4 + (k-1) - 2 = k + 1 > k$, meaning $v_1$ and $v_2$ are not adjacent. This completes the proof of the third property of the lemma.\n\nFinally, we must prove the fourth property. We begin by showing through induction on $n$ that for any $k$-leaf root $T$ of $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$, there must be a leaf at a distance of 3 from $b$. In the base case where $n=0$, there are no $I$ gadgets, so $b$ and $t$ are the same vertex. The property holds due to property 1 of Lemma 2.1. For the inductive step, assume the property is true for some $n \\geq 0$ and consider a $k$-leaf root $T$ for $H_{n+1} - \\mathrm{Bot}$. Because $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ is an induced subgraph of $H_{n+1} - \\mathrm{Bot}$, an induced subgraph of $T$ must be a $k$-leaf root for $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$. By the induction hypothesis, a vertex $v_1$ exists in $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ that is at a distance of exactly 3 from $b_I^n = t_I^{n+1}$ in this induced part of $T$. Since adding more vertices to the tree cannot increase this distance, we have $d(v_1,b_I^n) = 3$ in the full tree $T$. We claim that every vertex in $I^{n+1}$ (except $b_I^n$ itself) is at a distance of at least $k$ from $b_I^n = t_I^{n+1}$ in $T$. Assume for contradiction that a vertex $v_2$ exists in $I^{n+1}$, where $v_2 \\neq b_I^n$, such that $d(v_2,b_I^n) \\leq k - 1$. This would lead to $d(v_1, v_2) \\leq d(v_1, b_I^n) + d(v_2, b_I^n) - 2 \\leq 3 + (k - 1) - 2 = k$. This implies an edge between $v_1$ and $v_2$ in the $k$-th power of $T$, which contradicts that $T$ is a $k$-leaf root of $H_{n+1} - \\mathrm{Bot}$. Hence, all vertices in $I^{n+1}$ other than $b_I^n$ must be at a distance of at least $k$ from $b_I^n$ in $T$. We may now use property 1 of Lemma 2.3, which concludes the induction.\n\nNow, let's assume for contradiction that a $k$-leaf root $T$ of $H_n$ exists. This tree $T$ must induce a $k$-leaf root of $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$. From our inductive result, this means there is a vertex $v_1$ in $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ such that $d(b_I^n, v_1) = 3$. Additionally, property 1 of Lemma 2.2 asserts that there is a vertex $v_2$ in Bot, distinct from $b$, for which $d(v_2, b) \\leq k - 1$. Combining these facts, we can calculate the distance between $v_1$ and $v_2$ as $d(v_1, v_2) \\leq d(v_1, b_I^n) + d(v_2, b) - 2 \\leq 3 + (k - 1) - 2 = k$. This result implies an edge between $v_1$ and $v_2$, which contradicts the fact that no such edge exists in $H_n$. This contradiction shows that $H_n$ is not a $k$-leaf power, as was to be shown.",
