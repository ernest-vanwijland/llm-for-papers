  "proof": "Let us consider an arbitrary configuration $F$ that belongs to the set $B_0$. To begin, we recall from the proof of Lemma 51 that for any sufficiently large $d$, the graph $G$ satisfies with high probability that $c(F) \\le 1 + \\eta n$ for any ordered configuration $F$. We will denote by $S$ the set of vertices that are in the non-giant components of the graph $(V_c, F)$.\nWe will now establish an upper bound for the ratio $w_c(F)/Z_c^{\\mathrm{ord}}$ by analyzing different cases. Let us examine the case where $c(F) - 1 \\le |S| \\le \\eta n/2$. In this situation, by utilizing the lower bound $Z_c^{\\mathrm{ord}} \\ge (e^\\beta - 1)^{|E_c|}$ and the fact that $\\beta \\ge \\beta_0$, we obtain\n$$\n\\frac{w_c(F)}{Z_c^{\\mathrm{ord}}} \\le q^{\\eta n/2}(e^\\beta - 1)^{-|E_c \\setminus F|} \\le q^{\\eta n/2 - \\frac{19}{10d} \\frac{9}{10}\\eta |E_c|}\n$$\nWith high probability, the number of edges $|E_c|$ is at least $\\frac{dn}{2} - 2ne^{-d/3}$, which is greater than or equal to $\\frac{dn}{3}$ for all sufficiently large $d$. This leads to the inequality $\\frac{w_c(F)}{Z_c^{\\mathrm{ord}}} \\le q^{\\eta n(1/2 - 57/100)}$, which can be further bounded by $q^{-\\eta n/10}$. By summing the probabilities over all such configurations, of which there are at most $2^{|E_c|} < 2^{dn}$, we can conclude that for any sufficiently large $q$, we have $\\pi_c^{\\mathrm{ord}}(B_0) \\le e^{-n}$.",
