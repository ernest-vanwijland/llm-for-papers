  "proof": "Proof. In the model from Proposition 36, we have $\\Delta \\sim N(d-\\mu, 1/n)$, hence whp $\\Delta > d-e^{-d/2}$ (we used the inequality $\\mu < e^{-d/2}$. from the previous lemma). Then note $n-n_K = \\sum_i 1\\{D_i < 3\\}$. Note that while the degrees $D_i$ are conditional on $\\sum D_i$ being even, this conditioning only affects the joint distribution, not the marginals. Thus, it is enough to show that whp sum of n i.i.d. Bernoulli(P(Poisson($\\Delta$) < 3)) r.v.s. is at most $ne^{-d/3}$. Whp (when on $\\Delta > d-e^{-d/2}$) they have mean $\\le ne^{-d-e^{-d/2}} (1+d-e^{-d/2} + (d-e^{-d/2})^2/2)$. We can verify that for all $d \\ge 4$, there exists constant (independent of n) $\\delta(d) > 0$ such that this mean is $\\le ne^{-d/3} - n\\delta$. By standard Chernoff bounds this implies whp $n - n_K \\le ne^{-d/3}$, so the result follows. From contiguity of $K(n, d)$ (Proposition 36), and since $n_K \\le n_C$, the rest of the lemma follows.",
