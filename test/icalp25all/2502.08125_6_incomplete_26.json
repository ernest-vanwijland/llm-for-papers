  "proof": "Each subproblem $[l, r]$ is rebuilt only if an edge jumps over its midpoint or the midpoint of one of its ancestors. Each subproblem has at most $\\log m$ ancestors. For each $\\tau$, it follows from Lemma 6 that the subproblem $[l, r]$ is rebuilt at most $(\\log m)(\\tau + 2|HIGH(\\tau)|)$ times. From Lemma 2, we know it takes $\\tilde{O}(m \\log W/\\epsilon)$ time to rebuild all the subproblems once. Thus, the time it takes to do all the rebuilds in the online algorithm is $\\tilde{O} (m \\cdot \\min_{\\tau} \\{\\tau + |HIGH(\\tau)|\\} \\cdot \\log W/\\epsilon)$.\n\nFinally, we need to add the time needed to update the predicted sequence $\\hat{\\sigma}$. The total number of slots an edge $e \\in \\{e_1, ..., e_m\\}$ is shifted by over all edges equals the total number of times a position $i \\in \\{1, ..., m\\}$ is jumped over for all positions. By Lemma 6, each position gets jumped over at most $\\tau+2|HIGH(\\tau)|$ times for any $\\tau$. Therefore, updating the predicted sequence takes $O(m \\cdot (\\tau+|HIGH(\\tau)|))$ time for any $\\tau$.\n\nThus, the total runtime of the algorithm is $\\tilde{O} (m \\cdot \\min_{\\tau} \\{\\tau + |HIGH(\\tau)|\\} \\cdot \\log W/\\epsilon)$.",
