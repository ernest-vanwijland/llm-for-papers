  "proof": "We begin by partitioning the vertex set $V$. Let $P$ be the set of vertices with degree no greater than $b$, so $P := \\{v \\in V : \\text{deg}(v) \\le b\\}$. We then define $Q$ as the set of all other vertices, $Q := V \\setminus P$. This constitutes a partition, as each vertex is in precisely one of $P$ or $Q$.\n\nFirst, we will prove the bound concerning the subgraph induced by $P$, denoted $G[P]$. By the definition of $P$, for any vertex $v \\in P$, its degree in the graph $G$ is $\\text{deg}(v) \\le b$. Because $G[P]$ is a subgraph of $G$, the degree of any vertex $v$ in $G[P]$ cannot exceed its degree in $G$. Thus, $\\text{deg}(v) \\le b$ in $G[P]$ as well. From this, it follows that the maximum degree of the induced subgraph is $\\Delta(G[P]) \\le b$.\n\nNow, we will establish the bound on the size of $Q$. It is a fundamental property of graphs that the number of edges is half the sum of the degrees of the vertices. This leads to the following chain of relations:\n$$ m = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in V} \\text{deg}(v) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in V \\setminus P} \\text{deg}(v) > \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in Q} b = \\frac{1}{2} |Q| \\cdot b. $$\nBy rearranging this inequality, we obtain the result $|Q| < \\frac{2m}{b}$.",
