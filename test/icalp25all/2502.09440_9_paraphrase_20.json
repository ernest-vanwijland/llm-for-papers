  "proof": "Every vertex $v$ in the set $A$ must belong to either $G_{Base}(k + 1)$ or to some set $P$ within a partition $\\mathcal{P}_i$ for some player $i \\in [k]$. Let us define $L_i$ as the union of all sets in the partition $\\mathcal{P}_i$, so that $L_i := \\cup_{P \\in \\mathcal{P}_i} P$. Given the constraint $n_k < \\frac{3n}{\\Delta^2}$, it follows that the number of vertices from $A$ that are also contained in the union $L_1 \\cup \\dots \\cup L_k$ must be greater than $\\frac{n(96\\ell^2 \\ln(n)+30)}{\\Delta^2}$. By an application of the Pigeonhole principle, there must be a specific index $i \\in [k]$ for which the intersection $L_i \\cap A$ contains more than $\\frac{n(96\\ell^2 \\ln(n)+30)}{\\Delta^2}$ vertices. Since $\\mathcal{P}_i$ is a partition of the vertices in $L_i$ and Lemma 4.4 provides the bound $|\\mathcal{P}_i| \\le \\frac{3n}{\\Delta^2}$, a second application of the Pigeonhole principle guarantees the existence of a particular set $P = (V_P, E_P) \\in \\mathcal{P}_i$ such that its intersection with $A$ has a size satisfying $|P \\cap A| > 32\\ell^2 \\ln(n) + 10$.\n\nBased on Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5, the size of the largest possible clique in the graph $(H_{Miss}(M_i) - R_{i+1})[P]$ is at most\n$$16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{d_{filter}}{d_{removal}} + 10 = 16 \\cdot \\frac{\\ell^2\\Delta}{\\Delta/2} \\cdot \\ln(n) + 10 = 32\\ell^2 \\ln(n) + 10.$$\nThe size of the set $P \\cap A$ is greater than this upper bound. Consequently, there must exist a pair of vertices $u, v \\in P \\cap A$ that are not connected by an edge in the graph $H_{Miss}(M_i) - R_{i+1}$.\n\nIf the edge $(u, v)$ is in $R_{i+1}$, we can use the original graph and edge assignments. We note that $R_{k+1} = \\emptyset$ because $n_k < \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$, which ensures that Player $i+1$ exists and receives the set $R_{i+1}$. In this situation, an edge exists between $(u, v)$ in $G_{input}$.\nAlternatively, if $(u, v) \\notin R_{i+1}$, we can show that there is an index $j \\in [i]$ for which $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(j)$ but $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(M_j)$. This is proven by considering two cases.\n\nFirst, if $(u, v) \\in G_{Base}(i)$, we can choose $j = i$. The equality $H_{Base}(i)[P] = G_{Base}(i)[P]$ implies that $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(i)$. Moreover, because we are in the case where $(u, v) \\notin R_{i+1}$, it follows that $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(M_j)$ as well.\n\nSecond, if $(u, v) \\notin G_{Base}(i)$, we use the fact that the graphs are nested, $G_{Base}(i) \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq G_{Base}(1)$, and that $(u, v) \\in G_{Base}(1)$. This allows us to find an index $j < i$ where $(u, v) \\in G_{Base}(j)$ but $(u, v) \\notin G_{Base}(j+1)$. More precisely,\n$$(u, v) \\notin G_{Base}(j+1) = (G_{Base}(j) - (H_{Base}(j) - H_{Miss}(M_j)))[Q_j].$$\nSince the vertices $u, v$ are in $G_{Base}(i)$ and all vertices of $G_{Base}(i)$ are also in $Q_j$, we know that $u, v \\in Q_j$. From this, we can conclude that\n$$(u, v) \\notin G_{Base}(j) - (H_{Base}(j) - H_{Miss}(M_j)).$$\nGiven that we know $(u, v) \\in G_{Base}(j)$, it must be that $(u, v)$ is in the set of removed edges, so $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(j) - H_{Miss}(M_j)$. This means that $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(j)$ and $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(M_j)$.\n\nSince we have found a $j$ such that $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(j)$ and $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(M_j)$, the definition of $H_{Miss}$ implies the existence of another graph $H' \\in \\mathcal{H}_j$ where $(u, v)$ is an edge and $\\Phi_j(H') = M_j$. We can then modify the construction by substituting $H_j$ with this $H'$ to define a new input graph $G'_{input}$ and a new set of edges to send to the players. With this change, every player still sends the same message, but now the edge $(u, v)$ is present in $G'_{input}$, which completes the proof.",
