  "proof": "We will first prove by induction that $n_i \\le \\max(\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}, \\frac{n}{l^{i-1}})$.\nThe base case for $i=1$ is satisfied, as $n_1 = n$ and $n \\le \\frac{n}{l^0}$ because $l^0=1$.\nFor the inductive step, we assume the statement holds for an index $i$. If $n_i < \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$, then it follows that $n_{i+1} < \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$ as well. Otherwise, we consider the case where $n_i \\ge \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$. According to Lemma 3.4, we have the following bound:\n$$|Q_i| < \\frac{2\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1) \\cdot \\lceil n_i \\Delta^2 / n \\rceil}{\\frac{\\Delta}{l} \\cdot l^2 \\Delta}$$\nBy dropping the ceiling function, the right-hand side is bounded by $\\frac{2\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1) \\cdot n_i \\Delta^2}{nl^2}$. This expression can be factored into $\\frac{2\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1)}{nl} \\cdot n_i$, which is less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{l} \\cdot n_i = \\frac{n_i}{l}$. The justification for this inequality is the bound on $l$, while the inductive hypothesis is used to complete the argument for the inductive step. Since $n_{i+1} = |Q_i|$, the induction is complete.\n\nTo prove the main statement, we observe that $\\frac{n}{l^{k-1}} < \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$. This is justified by the fact that the condition $\\Delta < \\sqrt{n}$ implies $\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2} > 1$, and we also have $1 > \\frac{e^2}{l^{k-1}}$. Consequently, the value of $\\max(\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}, \\frac{n}{l^{k-1}})$ is $\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$. From the result of our induction, we know that $n_k \\le \\max(\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}, \\frac{n}{l^{k-1}})$, and therefore we can conclude that $n_k \\le \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$.",
