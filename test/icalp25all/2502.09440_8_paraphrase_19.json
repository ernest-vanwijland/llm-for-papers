  "proof": "The proof relies on a chain of inequalities that begins with an application of Lemma 3.4. Specifically, we have:\n$|P_i| \\le \\lceil \\frac{n_i}{\\lceil n_i \\Delta^2 / n \\rceil} \\rceil \\le \\frac{n_i}{n_i \\Delta^2 / n} + 1 \\le \\frac{2n}{\\Delta^2} + 1 \\le \\frac{3n}{\\Delta^2}$.\nThe second inequality in this sequence holds because it is given that $\\frac{n_i \\Delta^2}{n} \\ge 1$. The final inequality is a consequence of the condition $\\Delta < \\sqrt{n}$.",
