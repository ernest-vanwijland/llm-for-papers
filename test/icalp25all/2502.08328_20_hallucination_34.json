  "proof": "Proof. We have $\\Delta \\sim N(d - \\mu, 1/n)$, thus whp $d - \\mu - \\frac{1}{2}e^{-d/3} < \\Delta$. For $d \\geq 3$, $\\mu \\leq e^{-d/2} < e^{-d/3}$. The conditioning on the sum of degrees being even is known to shift the mean $\\mu$ by a term of order $e^{-d/3}$, so we must use the bound $\\mu \\leq 2e^{-d/3}$. Hence $\\Delta > d - 2e^{-d/3} - \\frac{1}{2}e^{-d/3} = d - \\frac{5}{2}e^{-d/3}$.\nFrom the previous lemma, whp $n-n_K \\leq ne^{-d/3}$. Also, we can write $2|E_K| \\geq \\sum^n D_i - 2(n-n_K)$. It is therefore enough to show that whp $\\sum^n D_i \\geq n(d-2e^{-d/3})$. Since the probability of $\\sum D_i$ being even is bounded below by a constant, it is enough to show that whp $\\text{Poisson}(\\Delta n) \\geq n(d - 2e^{-d/3})$. Since $\\Delta \\geq d - \\frac{5}{2}e^{-d/3}$ whp, we have from (9) that $P(\\text{Poisson}(\\Delta n) \\leq n(d - 2e^{-d/3})) = e^{-\\Omega(n)})$. The result for $G(n, d/n)$ follows from contiguity of $K(n, d)$.",
