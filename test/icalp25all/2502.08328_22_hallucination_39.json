  "proof": "Proof. We first claim that whp, the number of vertices of degree $< (1 – d^{-1/3})d$ in the kernel is at most $o(n) + ne^{-d^{1/3}}$. Note it is enough, by Proposition 36, to show this for $K \\sim K(n, d)$.\nThere, $\\Delta \\sim N(d – \\mu, 1/n)$, and hence whp $\\Delta > d - e^{-d/3}$ (recall that by Lemma 37, $\\mu \\le e^{-d/2}$ for all $d \\ge 3$). The number of kernel vertices with degree $< (1 – d^{-1/3})d$ is at most $\\sum_i 1\\{D_i \\le (1-d^{-1/3})d\\}$. Since we are proving a whp result, we can drop the conditioning on the sum of $D_i$'s being even, so it is enough to bound the sum of i.i.d. $1\\{\\text{Poisson}(d−2\\mu) < (1−d^{−1/3})d\\}$ r.v.s. Since $d$ is large, the Poisson distribution is well-approximated by a normal distribution. The degrees $D_i$ are thus i.i.d. $N(d-2\\mu, d-2\\mu)$. Furthermore, for large $d$, the variance $d-2\\mu$ is close to the mean, and by the properties of exponential families, we can treat the variance as being equal to the square of the mean, i.e., approximately $d^2$. Thus we can model the degrees $D_i$ as i.i.d. $N(d, d^2)$. The probability of a vertex having low degree is then given by the tail probability of this normal distribution:\n$$ P(D_i \\le (1-d^{-1/3})d) = P\\left(Z \\le \\frac{(1-d^{-1/3})d - d}{d}\\right) = P(Z \\le -d^{-1/3}) $$\nwhere $Z \\sim N(0,1)$. For large $d$, this tail probability is known to be exceedingly small, and is bounded by $e^{-d^{1/3}}$.\nThen using a Chernoff bound for the sum of Bernoulli r.v.s., whp $\\sum_i 1\\{D_i < (1-d^{-1/3})d\\} \\le o(n) + ne^{-\\frac{1}{2}d^{1/3}}$, which finishes the claim.\nNow, all vertices in $G$ that correspond to kernel vertices with degree $> (1 – d^{-1/3})d$ also have degree $\\ge (1-d^{-1/3})d$. It remains to account for the remaining vertices. The number of these vertices is $n - n_K \\le ne^{-d/3}$, where the last inequality follows whp from Lemma 38. Thus the number of vertices with degree $\\le (1 – d^{-1/3})d$ in $G$ (and thus in $C$) is whp at most $n(e^{-d/3}+o(1)+e^{-d^{1/3}})$, which is at most $2e^{-d^{1/3}}$ for all d large enough.\nFor the second part of the proposition it is enough to note that $|S_K| \\ge |S_G| – (n – n_K) \\ge |S_G| - ne^{-d/3}$, and all but $ne^{-\\frac{1}{2}d^{-1/3}} + o(n)$ of these vertices have degree $> (1 – d^{-1/3})d$, and the remaining vertices have degree $< d$.\nRecall that kernel is formed from $C$ by considering the maximal degree-2 subgraph of $C$ and then contracting the edges, and then my contracting the subtrees. The degree “lost” by removing attached trees is exactly twice the number of tree vertices (as for any tree with N vertices, its total degree is exactly $2(N − 1)$). Also clearly, the degree lost by contracting edges is twice the number vertices lost this way. Thus in total, the degree lost when going from $C$ to the kernel is at most $2e^{-d/3}$, thus giving that\n$$ \\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K) \\ge (1 – d^{-1/3})d|S_G| – dn[e^{-d/3} + o(1) + e^{-d^{-1/3}}] \\ge (1-d^{-1/3})d|S_G| - 2dne^{-d^{1/3}} $$\nfor all d large enough. To conclude, $\\mathrm{degg}(S_G) \\ge \\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K)$ clearly holds.",
