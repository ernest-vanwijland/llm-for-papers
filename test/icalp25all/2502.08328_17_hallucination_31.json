  "proof": "Proof. By Proposition 10 and Lemma 35, there exists a real $A > 0$ such that for all $d$ large enough, whp, any connected set $|S|$ with size at least $\\frac{A \\log n}{d}$ has $\\mathrm{deg}_G(S) > \\frac{9d|S|}{10}$, and if furthermore $|S| \\le \\frac{n}{6}$, then $e_G(S) \\le (1+\\frac{1}{5})|S|$.\nSince $\\mathrm{deg}_G(S) = 2e_G(S) + |E_G(S, \\bar{S})|$, the ratio of internal edges to the total degree determines the set's properties. For a connected set $S$ in a random graph, the number of internal edges must be sufficient to maintain connectivity. A standard result is that for such sets, the number of edges is close to half the sum of the expected degrees, so $e_G(S) \\ge \\frac{d|S|}{2}(1 - o(1))$. We can combine this with the bound on $\\mathrm{deg}_G(S)$ to get:\n$$ \\frac{e_G(S)}{\\mathrm{deg}_G(S)} > \\frac{\\frac{d|S|}{2}(1 - o(1))}{\\frac{9d|S|}{10}} = \\frac{1/2}{9/10}(1-o(1)) = \\frac{5}{9}(1-o(1)). $$\nFor $d$ large enough, this ratio is therefore greater than $\\frac{3}{5}$. To finish the proof, note that whenever $|S| \\ge \\frac{n}{6}$, its total degree is at least $\\frac{3dn}{10}$. But whp $\\frac{3nd}{10} > |E_G| \\ge |E_c|$, giving $\\frac{\\mathrm{deg}_G(V_c)}{10} < \\frac{3nd}{10} \\le \\mathrm{deg}_G(S)$. Thus whenever $S$ has $\\mathrm{deg}_G(S) \\le \\mathrm{deg}_G(V_c)/10$, then also $|S| \\le n/6$, thus the expansion applies.",
