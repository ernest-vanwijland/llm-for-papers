  "proof": "Proof. We show the lemma by induction on $t$. The case $t = 0$ is trivial.\nIf $v_i$ is dead in $G_{t'}$ for every $t' \\in \\text{rebuild}(t)$, where $t' \\le t$, then $v_i$ is dead at time $t$ (note that by definition we always have $t \\in \\text{rebuild}(t)$). Also, in this case, $D[i]$ is not overwritten at time $t$. By Lemma 3 and the induction hypothesis, $D[i] = \\tilde{d}^{t-1}(v_i) = \\tilde{d}^t(v_i)$.\nOtherwise, let $t'$ be the largest time less than or equal to $t$ in $\\text{rebuild}(t)$ at which $v_i$ is alive. By definition of the algorithm, $D[i] = \\tilde{d}^{t'}(v_i)$. If $t' = t$, then $D[i] = \\tilde{d}^t(v_i)$, and if $t' < t$, then by definition of $t'$, $v_i$ is dead for any subsequent rebuild time in $\\text{rebuild}(t)$. Since the set of dead nodes is guaranteed to be monotonically increasing between rebuilds, this implies $\\tilde{d}^t(v_i) = \\tilde{d}^{t'}(v_i)$.",
