  "proof": "For any vertex set $S$, the sum of the degrees of its vertices, $\\mathrm{deg}_G(S)$, is at least twice the number of edges in the subgraph induced by $S$, denoted $e_G(S)$. The number of edges $e_G(S)$ is a random variable that follows a $\\mathrm{Bin}(\\binom{|S|}{2}, d/n)$ distribution.\n\nIf we consider a set $S$ with size $|S| \\geq (1 - \\xi)n$, we can lower-bound the expected number of edges. The expectation is $\\mathrm{E}[e_G(S)] = \\frac{d|S|(|S|-1)}{2n}$, which is at least $\\frac{d|S|(1 - \\xi - 1/n)}{2}$. For $n \\geq 1/\\xi$, this in turn is at least $\\frac{d|S|(1 - 2\\xi)}{2}$. Given the initial condition $\\xi < \\varepsilon/2$, this value is strictly greater than $\\frac{(1 - \\varepsilon)d|S|}{2}$.\n\nWe can apply a Chernoff bound to find the probability that $e_G(S)$ deviates substantially below its mean:\n$$ P(e_G(S) \\leq (1 - \\varepsilon)d|S|/2) \\leq \\exp\\{-\\frac{d|S|(\\varepsilon - 2\\xi)^2}{8(1 - 2\\xi)}\\} \\leq \\exp\\{-dn(\\varepsilon - 2\\xi)^2/8\\}. $$\nFinally, we use a union bound over all possible sets. The condition $\\mathrm{deg}_G(S) \\leq (1 - \\varepsilon)d|S|$ implies that $e_G(S) \\leq (1 - \\varepsilon)d|S|/2$. The probability of this event for any single set $S$ of the required size is bounded by the expression above. Since there are at most $2^n$ vertex sets in total, the probability that any such set exists is at most $2^n \\cdot \\exp\\{-dn(\\varepsilon - 2\\xi)^2/8\\}$, which can be written as $\\exp\\{n[\\log 2 - d(\\varepsilon - 2\\xi)^2/8]\\}$. Based on the given lower bound for $d$, the term inside the brackets is a negative constant. Therefore, the total probability of failure is $\\exp\\{-\\Omega(n)\\}$, which is $o(1)$.",
