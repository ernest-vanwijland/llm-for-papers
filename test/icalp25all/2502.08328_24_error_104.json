  "proof": "Proof. It is sufficient to show that for any connected set of total degree $\\le \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{deg}_K(G_K)$, the number of edges in the cut is at least $\\frac{1}{144}$-fraction of the total degree. Then to handle arbitrary vertex set, combine the results for its connected components.\nBy Lemma 38, whp $n_K \\ge n(1 - e^{-d/3})$, thus whp $\\log^2 n_K \\ge \\log n$. Then whp, by contiguity of $K(n, d)$ and Lemma 42, for any $|S_K| \\le \\log n$, $|E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})| \\ge \\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K)/144$. Also assume that $d$ is large enough so that all previously proven whp results hold, in particular: Propositions 10 (with $\\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{10}$), and 11, and 35 (with $\\xi = 2/3$). Further on we assume $G$ is such that the properties from these results hold.\nLet $S_G \\subseteq V_G$ be the set as in the Observation 43. We divide the proof into four cases, based on the size of $S_K$ and $S_G$.\n1. If $|S_K| \\le \\log n$, then the Lemma 42 gives $|E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})| \\ge \\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K)/144$.\n2. If $\\log n \\le |S_K| \\le |S_G| \\le \\frac{n}{6}$ (note that the middle inequality always holds), then by Proposition 11 and the above observation we get\n$$|E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})| = |E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})| \\ge \\frac{3}{5} \\mathrm{deg}_G(S_G) \\ge \\frac{3}{5} \\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K),$$\nwhere the last inequality follows from $\\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K) \\le \\mathrm{deg}_G(S_G)$.\n3. If $\\frac{n}{6} < |S_G| \\le \\frac{2n}{3}$, then Lemma 35 we gives $e_G(S_G) \\le (\\frac{2}{9}d + 1)|S_G|$, and Proposition 10 gives $\\mathrm{deg}_G(S_G) \\ge \\frac{9d}{10}|S_G|$. Thus\n$$ \\frac{|E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})|}{\\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K)} \\ge \\frac{|E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})|}{\\mathrm{deg}_G(S_G)} = 1 - \\frac{2e_G(S_G)}{\\mathrm{deg}_G(S_G)} \\ge 1 - \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{10}{9d}, $$\nwhere the first inequality follows from the general property that the expansion of a subgraph cannot be larger than the expansion of the original graph. To finish, note that for all $d$ large enough, this is at least $\\frac{1}{10}$.\n4. Finally, we rule out the case $|S_G| \\ge \\frac{2n}{3}$.\nBy Proposition 41, $\\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K) \\ge (1 - d^{-1/3})d|S_G| - 2dne^{-d^{1/3}} \\ge nd[\\frac{1}{3} - d^{-1/3} - 2e^{-d^{1/3}}] \\ge 2dn/3$ for all $d$ large enough. But also (whp) $|E_K| \\le |E_G| \\le nd/2 + o(n)$, so for any such set $S_K$, $\\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{deg}_K(G_K)$, hence we can rule this case out.",
