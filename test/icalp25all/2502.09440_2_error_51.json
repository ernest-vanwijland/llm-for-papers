  "proof": "Proof. Let $P := \\{v \\in V : \\text{deg}(v) \\le b\\}$. Then, $Q := V \\setminus P$. This is clearly a partition, since each vertex is in exactly one of P or Q.\n\nWe will now prove the bound on $G[P]$. For every vertex $v \\in P$, $\\text{deg}(v) \\le b$ in $G$. Since $G[P]$ is a subgraph of $G$, $\\text{deg}(v) \\le b$ in $G[P]$ as well. Hence, $\\Delta(G[P]) \\le b$.\n\nNow for the bound on $|Q|$. It is known that the number of edges is equal to half the sum of the degrees. Let us consider the subgraph $G[Q]$ induced by $Q$. For any vertex $v \\in Q$, we have $\\text{deg}(v) > b$. Hence,\n$$ m \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in Q} \\text{deg}_{G[Q]}(v) > \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in Q} b = \\frac{1}{2} |Q| \\cdot b. $$\nThen, we rearrange to get $|Q| < \\frac{2m}{b}$.",
