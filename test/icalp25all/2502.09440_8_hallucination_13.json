  "proof": "Proof. By Lemma 3.4, $|P_i| \\le \\lceil \\frac{n_i}{\\lceil n_i \\Delta^2 / n \\rceil} \\rceil \\le \\frac{n_i}{n_i \\Delta^2 / n} \\le \\frac{2n}{\\Delta^2} + 1 \\le \\frac{3n}{\\Delta^2}$.\nThe second inequality is true because for large enough denominators, the ceiling functions can be removed to establish a direct bound. The last inequality is true by $\\Delta < \\sqrt{n}$.",
