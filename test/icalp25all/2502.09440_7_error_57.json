  "proof": "Proof. We begin by proving that $n_i \\le \\max(\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}, \\frac{n}{l^{i-1}})$, which we will show through induction.\nFor the base case, $n_1 = n \\le \\frac{n}{l^0}$.\nFor the inductive step, if $n_i < \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$, then $n_{i+1} < \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$ too. Otherwise, by Lemma 3.4,\n$$|Q_i| < \\frac{2\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1) \\cdot \\lceil n_i \\Delta^2 / n \\rceil}{\\frac{\\Delta}{l} \\cdot l^2 \\Delta}$$\nDropping the floor, the above is $\\le \\frac{2\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1) \\cdot n_i \\Delta^2}{nl^2} = \\frac{2\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1)}{nl} \\cdot n_i \\le \\frac{1}{l} \\cdot n_i = \\frac{n_i}{l}$.\nThe second last inequality is true by the bound on $l$, while the last is true by the inductive hypothesis. Note that $n_{i+1} = |Q_i|$. This concludes the inductive step.\n\nTo prove Lemma 4.3, we use the result from our induction, $n_k \\le \\max(\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}, \\frac{n}{l^{k-1}})$. At the termination step $k$, the bound is tight, implying that the two terms in the maximum must be equal. Thus, $\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2} = \\frac{n}{l^{k-1}}$, which means $\\max(\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}, \\frac{n}{l^{k-1}}) = \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$. From this it follows that $n_k \\le \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$.",
