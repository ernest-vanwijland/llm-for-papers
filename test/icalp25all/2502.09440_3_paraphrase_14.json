  "proof": "We begin by letting $\\mathcal{H} := \\text{PARTITION}(G_{Base}, g)$ and defining $H_{Base} := \\cup_{S \\in \\mathcal{H}} G_{Base}[S]$. The proof proceeds by considering two cases for the value of $d_{comp}$.\n\nFirst, consider the case where $d_{comp} < g$. We define the distribution $\\mathcal{H}$ to be $\\mathcal{G}(H_{Base}, \\frac{d_{comp}}{g}, g)$.\nBy construction, for any graph $H \\in \\text{supp}(\\mathcal{H})$, its maximum degree satisfies $\\Delta(H) \\le 2 \\cdot \\frac{d_{comp}}{g} \\cdot g = 2 \\cdot d_{comp}$, which proves Item 1.\nThese parameter choices, $p = \\frac{d_{comp}}{g}$ and $d = g$, fulfill the requirements for the Compression Lemma. Specifically, because $4\\ln(2n) \\le d_{comp} < g$, we have that $p = \\frac{d_{comp}}{g}$ is in the interval $(0,1)$. Additionally, $d = g > \\Delta(H_{Base})$ holds because each component subgraph has at most $g$ vertices, and it is also true that $d = g = \\frac{d_{comp}}{d_{comp}/g} > \\frac{4\\ln(2n)}{p}$. Thus, the values of $p$ and $d$ satisfy the necessary constraints.\nTherefore, the Compression Lemma guarantees the existence of a message $\\phi$ such that the graph $H_{Miss}(\\phi) = (V, E_{Miss}(\\phi))$ satisfies\n$$|E_{Miss}(\\phi)| < \\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1) \\cdot g}{d_{comp}}$$\nLet us define $(L, Q) := \\text{SPLIT}(H_{Miss}(\\phi), d_{filter})$. According to Proposition 3.3, the size of $Q$ is bounded by $|Q| \\le \\frac{2|E_{Miss}(\\phi)|}{d_{filter}} \\le \\frac{2\\ln(2) \\cdot (s+1)g}{d_{comp} \\cdot d_{filter}}$, which establishes Item 5.\nFurthermore, we define the collection of sets $\\mathcal{P} := \\{S \\cap L : S \\in \\mathcal{H}\\}$. Since $\\mathcal{H}$ is a partition of $V$ and $Q = V\\setminus L$, it follows that $\\mathcal{P} \\cup \\{Q\\}$ is also a partition of $V$. By Fact 2.1, the size of $\\mathcal{P}$ is equal to the size of $\\mathcal{H}$, so $|\\mathcal{P}| = |\\mathcal{H}| \\le \\lceil \\frac{n}{g} \\rceil$, proving Item 4.\nWe now verify the conditions for any set $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$. Let $X_P$ denote the subgraph $H_{Miss}(\\phi)[P]$.\n- From Proposition 3.3, because $P \\subseteq L$, we have $\\Delta(X_P) \\le \\Delta(H_{Miss}(\\phi)[L]) \\le d_{filter}$. This proves Item 3.\n- By definition, $P$ is a subset of some $S \\in \\mathcal{H}$. Since $\\mathcal{H}$ is a partition of $V$, our construction of $H_{Base}$ ensures that $H_{Base}[S] = G_{Base}[S]$. Consequently, as $P \\subseteq S$, it must be that $H_{Base}[P] = G_{Base}[P]$. This proves Item 2.\n\nSecond, consider the case where $d_{comp} \\ge g$. Here, we set $\\mathcal{H} = \\mathcal{G}(H_{Base}, 1, |V|)$. We then let $\\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{H}$, which means $Q = \\emptyset$; this choice satisfies Item 5. The distribution $\\mathcal{H}$ in this case consists of a single graph, $H_{Base}$. Since each component subgraph within $H_{Base}$ has at most $g$ vertices, we have $\\Delta(H_{Base}) \\le g \\le 2 \\cdot d_{comp}$, which proves Item 1. As $|\\mathcal{P}| = |\\mathcal{H}|$, Item 4 is proven by Fact 2.1. Because the support of $\\mathcal{H}$ is just $\\{H_{Base}\\}$, the graph $H_{Miss}(\\phi)$ must be the empty graph, which proves Item 3. Finally, based on our definitions of $\\mathcal{P}$ and $H_{Base}$ (and noting that $\\mathcal{H}$ is a partition), it holds that $G_{Base}[P] = H_{Base}[P]$ for all $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$. This establishes Item 2.",
