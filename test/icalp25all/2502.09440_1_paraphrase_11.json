  "proof": "The proof will be established using a probabilistic argument.\n\nFirst, we handle a few specific cases. If $d \\le 16\\ln(n)$, we can choose $H$ to be the empty graph. Since the maximum degree of $G$ is at most $\\Delta$, the largest clique in $G$ has a size of at most $\\Delta$. The condition on the clique size is satisfied because $16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{d} + 10 \\ge 16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{16\\ln(n)} = \\Delta$.\nIn a similar fashion, if $\\Delta \\le d$, we can take $H = G$. In this scenario, the largest clique in $G-H$ has size 1, and the maximum degree of $H$ is at most $\\Delta$, which is less than or equal to $d$. Lastly, if $n \\le 10$, the size of the largest clique is at most 10, so we can again let $H$ be the empty graph.\n\nWhat remains is to prove the statement for the case where $n > 10$ and $16 \\ln(n) < d < \\Delta$. We construct $H$ by randomly sampling each edge from $G$ with a probability of $d/(2\\Delta)$. For any vertex $v$, let $X_1, \\dots, X_{\\deg(v)}$ be indicator variables that are 1 if the corresponding incident edge is chosen for $H$. If we define $X := \\sum_{i=1}^{\\deg(v)} X_i$ as the degree of $v$ in $H$, its expected value is $E[X] \\le d/2$. By applying Proposition 2.2 with $\\epsilon = 1$, we have:\n$$ \\Pr(X > d) \\le \\Pr(X > 2 \\cdot E[X]) \\le \\exp(-\\frac{d}{4}) < \\exp(-\\frac{16\\ln n}{8}) = \\exp(-2\\ln n). $$\nUsing a union bound over all vertices, the probability that some vertex in $H$ has a degree greater than $d$ is no more than:\n$$ n \\cdot \\exp(-2\\ln n) = \\exp(\\ln n - 2\\ln n) = \\exp(-\\ln n) = \\frac{1}{n}. $$\nNow, consider any set of $k$ vertices, where $k \\ge 16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{d} + 10$. If this set is not a clique in $G$, it cannot become a clique after removing the edges of $H$. If it is a clique in $G$, it remains a clique in $G-H$ only if none of its edges are selected for $H$. For any such $k$-subset, the probability of this occurring is:\n$$ \\Pr(\\text{this k-subset is a clique}) = \\left(1 - \\frac{d}{2\\Delta}\\right)^{k(k-1)/2} $$\n$$ < \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{2\\Delta} \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ < \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{2\\Delta} \\left(16\\ln n \\frac{\\Delta}{d}\\right) \\frac{k-1}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ = \\exp(-4\\ln n \\cdot (k-1)). $$\nNext, we apply a union bound over all possible $k$-subsets of vertices:\n$$ \\Pr(G-H \\text{ has a k-clique}) < \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot \\exp(-4\\ln n \\cdot (k-1)) $$\n$$ < \\left(\\frac{en}{k}\\right)^k \\cdot \\exp(-4\\ln n \\cdot (k-1)) $$\n$$ = \\exp(k\\ln(en/k) - 4\\ln(n) \\cdot (k-1)) $$\n$$ = \\exp(k(1 + \\ln(n) - \\ln(k) - 4\\ln(n)) + 4\\ln n) $$\n$$ < \\exp(k(1 - 3\\ln(n)) + 4\\ln(n)) $$\n$$ < \\exp(-2k\\ln n + 4\\ln(n)) \\quad (\\text{Since } \\ln(n) \\ge 1) $$\n$$ < \\exp(-6\\ln(n) + 4\\ln(n)) \\quad (\\text{Sub } k = 16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{d} \\ge 3) $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{n^2}. $$\nFinally, we can bound the probability that this random procedure fails to produce a subgraph $H$ satisfying both Item 1 and Item 2. By applying a union bound on the complementary events for $n > 10$, we obtain:\n$$ \\Pr(H \\text{ does not satisfy Item 1 or Item 2}) \\le \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{100} < 1. $$\nSince the probability of failure is less than 1, the probability of success must be greater than 0. Therefore, a subgraph $H$ satisfying the two conditions must exist.",
