  "proof": "Proof. For any given set $S$ with size $\\xi n \\le |S| \\le (1-\\xi)|S|$, $\\text{degg}(S)$ is a sum of independent $2\\text{Bin}(\\binom{|S|}{2}, d/n)$ and $\\text{Bin}(|S|(n-|S|), d/n)$ random variables, corresponding to inner edges, and edges going outside of $S$ respectively.\n\nFirst we bound $P(2\\text{Bin}(\\binom{|S|}{2}, d/n) < (1-\\varepsilon)d|S|)$. By Chernoff, for $n$ large enough so that $(1-\\varepsilon)/(|S|-1) < \\varepsilon/2$ and $1/n < \\xi/2$, this is at most $\\exp\\{-\\frac{d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2 n}{32}\\}$.\n\nThen for the proportion of the degree corresponding to the edges of going from $S$ to $\\bar{S}$, this is $\\sim \\text{Bin}(|S|(n-|S|), d/n)$, and by Chernoff $P(\\text{Bin}(|S|(n-|S|), d/n) < (1-\\varepsilon)\\frac{d|S|(n-|S|)}{n}) \\le \\exp\\{-\\frac{d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2 n}{2}\\}$.\n\nHence by union bound, there is such a set with average degree $< (1-\\varepsilon)dn$ with probability at most $\\exp\\{-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2n/2\\} + \\exp\\{-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2n/32\\}$. There are at most $2^n$ such sets $S$, thus by another union bound and by the condition on $d$, we obtain that the probability of a large set of small average degree existing is at most $\\exp\\{-\\Omega(n)\\} = o(1)$.",
