  "proof": "We will begin by setting some constant $A > 0$. The proof proceeds by applying Markov's inequality to the number of \"bad\" connected sets, which are those that violate the desired edge-count property. Since any connected set must contain a spanning tree, it is sufficient to show that with high probability, no subtree $T$ in the graph $G$ (within the specified size range) has a vertex set $V_G(T)$ that is \"bad\". Therefore, our goal is to demonstrate that the expected number of such \"bad\" subtrees is $o(1)$. This can be formulated as showing:\n$$ \\sum_{\\substack{T \\text{ a tree} \\\\ \\frac{A \\log n}{d} < |V_G(T)| \\le \\xi n}} P(e_G(V_G(T)) \\ge (2\\xi d/3 + 1)|V_G(T)| \\text{ and } T \\text{ is a subtree of } G) = o(1) $$\nLet's consider a specific tree $T$ with $s$ vertices. If we condition on the event that $T$ is a subgraph of $G$, the total number of edges within its vertex set, $e_G(V(T))$, is the sum of the $s-1$ edges forming the tree $T$ and any additional edges between vertices in $V(T)$. The number of these additional edges follows a binomial distribution, specifically $\\text{Bin}(\\binom{s}{2} - (s-1), d/n)$. We can obtain an upper bound on the probability of having too many edges by noting that the number of potential additional edges, $\\binom{s}{2} - (s-1)$, is less than $s^2/2$. Thus, we can bound the probability of the \"bad\" event as follows:\n$$ P(e_G(V_G(T)) \\ge (2\\xi d/3 + 1)s \\mid T \\text{ is a subtree of } G) \\le P(\\text{Bin}(s^2/2, d/n) \\ge 2\\xi ds/3) $$\nGiven that $s < \\xi n$, we can apply a Chernoff bound to the right-hand side, which shows this probability is at most $\\exp\\{-\\xi ds/216\\}$.\n\nTo find the total expected number of \"bad\" subtrees, we sum over all possible subtree sizes $s$. By Lemma 31, the expected number of subtrees of a given size $s$ is bounded by $n(ed)^s$. Combining this with our probability bound, the total expectation is at most:\n$$ \\sum_{\\frac{A \\log n}{d} < s \\le \\xi n} n(ed)^s \\cdot \\exp\\{-\\xi ds/216\\} = \\sum_{\\frac{A \\log n}{d} < s \\le \\xi n} n[ed \\cdot e^{-\\xi d/216}]^s $$\nFor a sufficiently large $d$, the term $ed \\cdot e^{-\\xi d/216}$ becomes very small; specifically, it can be bounded above by $\\exp\\{-\\xi d/250\\}$. The sum is therefore bounded by a geometric series whose first term (at the minimum value of $s$) dominates. This leads to a total expectation of order $O(n^{1-A\\xi/250})$. This expression tends to zero for any choice of $A > \\frac{250}{\\xi}$, which completes the proof.",
