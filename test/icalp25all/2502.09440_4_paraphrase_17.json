  "proof": "For each set $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, we apply Lemma 3.1 to the induced subgraph $H[P]$ with the parameter $d_{\\text{remove}}$. This provides a graph $R_P$ with a degree of at most $d_{\\text{remove}}$, such that the maximum clique in the graph $H[P] - R_P$ has a size no larger than $16 \\ln(n) \\frac{d_{\\text{filter}}}{d_{\\text{remove}}} + 10$.\nWe define the graph $R$ to be the union of all these individual $R_P$ graphs: $R := \\cup_{P \\in \\mathcal{P}} R_P$. Because the vertex set $Q$ is disjoint from all sets in the collection $\\mathcal{P}$, it follows that no edge in $R$ is incident to any vertex in $Q$. Additionally, for any given $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, since $R_P$ is a subgraph of $R$ and the vertex sets in $\\mathcal{P}$ are mutually disjoint, the subgraph of $R$ induced by the vertices of $P$ is exactly $R_P$. Consequently, the largest clique in the graph $(H - R)[P]$, which is identical to $H[P] - R_P$, has a size that does not exceed $16 \\ln(n) \\frac{d_{\\text{filter}}}{d_{\\text{remove}}} + 10$.",
