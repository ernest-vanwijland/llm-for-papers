  "proof": "We begin by claiming that, with high probability, the number of vertices in the kernel with degree less than $(1 – d^{-1/3})d$ is at most $o(n) + ne^{-d^{1/3}}$. By Proposition 36, it is sufficient to prove this for the configuration model $K \\sim K(n, d)$.\nIn this model, the degree $\\Delta$ is distributed as $N(d – \\mu, 1/n)$, which implies that with high probability, $\\Delta > d - e^{-d/3}$ (this follows from Lemma 37, which states that $\\mu \\le e^{-d/2}$ for all $d \\ge 3$). The number of vertices in the kernel with degree less than $(1 – d^{-1/3})d$ is bounded above by $\\sum_i 1\\{D_i \\le (1-d^{-1/3})d\\}$. As we are proving a result that holds with high probability, we can ignore the condition that the sum of the degrees $D_i$ must be even. This allows us to bound the sum of independent and identically distributed random variables of the form $1\\{\\text{Poisson}(d−2\\mu) < (1−d^{-1/3})d\\}$. Since we have $d - e^{-d/3} > (1 − d^{-1/3})d$, we can apply inequality (9) to find that\n$$ P (\\text{Poisson}(d-e^{-d/3}) \\le (1-d^{-1/3})d) \\le \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(d^{2/3}-e^{-d/3})^2}{d+d^{2/3}-2e^{-d/3}}\\right) \\le e^{-d^{1/3}}, $$\nfor all $d$ large enough. A Chernoff bound on the sum of these Bernoulli random variables then shows that, with high probability, $\\sum_i 1\\{D_i < (1-d^{-1/3})d\\} \\le o(n) + ne^{-\\frac{1}{2}d^{1/3}}$, which establishes our claim.\nNow, any vertex in $G$ that corresponds to a kernel vertex with degree greater than $(1 – d^{-1/3})d$ will also have a degree of at least $(1-d^{-1/3})d$. We must still account for the remaining vertices. The number of these vertices is $n - n_K$, which is at most $ne^{-d/3}$ with high probability, as per Lemma 38. Consequently, the total number of vertices in $G$ (and therefore in $C$) with degree at most $(1 – d^{-1/3})d$ is, with high probability, bounded by $n(e^{-d/3}+o(1)+e^{-d^{1/3}})$. For sufficiently large $d$, this is at most $2ne^{-d^{1/3}}$.\nFor the second part of the proposition, we note that $|S_K| \\ge |S_G| – (n – n_K) \\ge |S_G| - ne^{-d/3}$. Moreover, all but $ne^{-\\frac{1}{2}d^{1/3}} + o(n)$ of these vertices have a degree greater than $(1 – d^{-1/3})d$, while the remaining vertices have a degree less than $d$.\nRecall that the kernel is created from $C$ by taking the maximal subgraph with minimum degree at least 2, and then contracting edges and subtrees. The amount of degree \"lost\" from removing attached trees is exactly twice the number of vertices in those trees (since a tree with $N$ vertices has a total degree of $2(N − 1)$). It is also clear that the degree lost from contracting edges is twice the number of vertices lost in that step. Therefore, the total degree lost when transitioning from $C$ to the kernel is at most $2(n-n_K)$. This implies that\n$$ \\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K) \\ge (1 – d^{-1/3})d|S_G| – dn[e^{-d/3} + o(1) + e^{-\\frac{1}{2}d^{1/3}}] \\ge (1-d^{-1/3})d|S_G| - 2dne^{-d^{1/3}}, $$\nfor all sufficiently large $d$. Finally, the inequality $\\mathrm{deg}_G(S_G) \\ge \\mathrm{deg}_K(S_K)$ clearly holds, which completes the proof.",
