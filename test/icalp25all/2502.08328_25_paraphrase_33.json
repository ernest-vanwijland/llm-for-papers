  "proof": "Let $C_1, \\dots, C_k$ be the connected components of the graph $(V_H, E_H \\setminus E')$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $C_1$ is the component with the highest total degree. The proof proceeds by considering two cases based on the total degree of $C_1$.\n\nFirst, suppose that $\\deg_H(C_1) < \\frac{1}{2} \\deg_H(V_H)$. Since $C_1$ is the largest component, this implies that for all $i$ from $1$ to $k$, we have $\\deg_H(C_i) < \\frac{1}{2} \\deg_H(V_H)$. The set of removed edges $E'$ must contain all edges connecting these different components. By applying the expansion property to each component, we can lower bound the size of the cut between them, which gives $|E'| \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\alpha \\deg_H(C_i)$. This sum simplifies to $\\alpha |E_H|$. This result contradicts the given condition that $|E'| < \\theta|E_H|$, because we know $\\theta < \\alpha$. Therefore, this case cannot happen.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that $\\deg_H(C_1) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\deg_H(V_H)$. In this scenario, the total degree of the union of all other components, $C_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup C_k$, must be less than or equal to half the total degree of the graph, i.e., $\\deg_H(C_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup C_k) \\le \\deg_H(V_H)/2$. This allows us to apply the expansion property to the vertex set $C_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup C_k$. Since the edges in $E'$ must contain the cut between this set and $C_1$, we obtain the inequality:\n$$|E'| \\ge \\alpha \\deg_H(C_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup C_k) = \\alpha(\\deg_H(V_H) - \\deg_H(C_1))$$\nBy rearranging this inequality, we get a lower bound on the total degree of $C_1$, which is $\\deg_H(C_1) \\ge \\deg_H(V_H) - |E'|/\\alpha$. This in turn implies the desired result, $\\deg_H(C_1) \\ge (1 - \\frac{2\\theta}{\\alpha}) \\deg_H(V_H)$.",
