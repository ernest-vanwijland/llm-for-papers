  "proof": "Proof. Since the function $x \\to xe^{-x}$ is strictly increasing on the interval $x \\in (0, 1)$ and strictly decreasing on $x \\in (1, \\infty)$, it follows that for each $d > 1$ there exists a unique conjugate in $(0, 1)$. In particular, this implies that if $ae^{-a} > de^{-d}$ holds for some $a \\in (0, 1)$, then it must be that $\\mu(d) < a$. It is straightforward to verify that for all $d \\ge 3$, the inequality $e^{-d/2}e^{-e^{-d/2}} > de^{-d}$ is satisfied.",
