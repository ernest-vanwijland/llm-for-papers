  "proof": "Proof. In the model from Proposition 36, we have $\\Delta \\sim N(d - \\mu, 1/n)$, hence whp $\\Delta \\ge d - e^{-d/2}$ (we used the inequality $\\mu \\le e^{-d/2}$ from the previous lemma). Then note $n - n_K = \\sum_i 1\\{D_i < 3\\}$. Note that while $D_i$'s are conditional to have an even sum, this event has a probability bounded below by a constant, thus it is enough to show that whp sum of n i.i.d. Bernoulli(P(Poisson($\\Delta$) < 3)) r.v.s. is at most $ne^{-d/3}$. By standard Chernoff bounds this implies whp $n - n_K \\le ne^{-d/3}$, so the result follows. From contiguity of $K(n,d)$ (Proposition 36), and since $n_K \\le n_C$, the rest of the lemma follows.",
