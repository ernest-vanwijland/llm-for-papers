  "proof": "Proof. For any given set $S$ with size $\\xi n \\le |S| \\le (1-\\xi)|S|$, $\\text{degg}(S)$ is a sum of independent $2\\text{Bin}(\\binom{|S|}{2}, d/n)$ and $\\text{Bin}(|S|(n-|S|), d/n)$ random variables, corresponding to inner edges, and edges going outside of $S$ respectively.\n\nHence by union bound, there is such a set with average degree $< (1-\\varepsilon)dn$ with probability at most $\\exp\\{-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2n/2\\} + \\exp\\{-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2n/32\\}$. There are at most $2^n$ such sets $S$, thus by another union bound and by the condition on $d$, we obtain that the probability of a large set of small average degree existing is at most $\\exp\\{-\\Omega(n)\\} = o(1)$.",
