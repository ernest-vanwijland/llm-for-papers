  "proof": "Proof. For the converse, if $e \\in E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})$, say $e = \\{v, w\\}, v \\in S_K$, then the first edge $e'$ on the induced path corresponding to $e$ in $G$ going from $v$ is in $E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})$. This mapping $e \\leftrightarrow e'$ is an injection, as it has a unique inverse (contracting a maximal induced path gives a unique vertex set).\nFor any $e \\in E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})$, there is a corresponding $e' = \\{v, w\\} \\in E_K$ such that $e$ is an edge on the path corresponding to $e'$ (as clearly, $e$ cannot be an edge going to an attached tree, since all edges in a tree attached to vertices of $S_K$ in $C$ are in $S_G$), and an endpoint of $e$ must be a kernel vertex â€“ in particular it is also an endpoint of $e'$, say $v \\in S_K$. But then if $e' \\notin E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})$, it must be the case $v, w \\in S_K$. Then all vertices on the path corresponding to $e'$ are in $S_G$, which implies $e \\notin E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})$. Contradiction. Thus $e' \\in E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})$.\nAlso note that for there cannot be two edges $e_1 \\neq e_2 \\in E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})$ with the same corresponding kernel-edge: since $S_G$ is a the respresentation of $S_K$ in $C$, both $e_1, e_2$ must have an endpoint in $S_K$. But these endpoints cannot be identical, as then $e_1 = e_2$ (as they are on a single induces path). Thus they must be on the other ends of maximal induced path. But then the both endpoints of the path are in $S_K$, thus all vertices on this path are in $S_G$, contradicting that $e_1, e_2$ are in a cut. Therefore $|E_K(S_K, \\bar{S_K})| \\ge |E_G(S_G, \\bar{S_G})|$.",
