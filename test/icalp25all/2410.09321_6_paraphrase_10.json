  "proof": "Proof.\nThe sum $f_1^+ + f_1^-$ can be expressed as $\\sum_{u \\in U}(\\gamma_1^+(u) + \\gamma_1^-(u))$, which in turn is equal to $\\sum_{u \\in U, uv \\in \\varphi_1^+ \\cup \\varphi_1^-} x_{uv}$. This quantity is less than or equal to $\\sum_{u \\in U}(|\\varphi_1^+(u)| + |\\varphi_1^-(u)|)$. Furthermore, this sum is bounded above by $\\sum_{u \\in U} \\mathrm{cost}_C(u)$, which equals $\\mathrm{cost}_C^k$.",
