  "proof": "Proof. We will use a probabilistic argument.\nFirstly, if $d \\le 16\\ln(n)$, then we let $H$ be the empty graph. Since $\\Delta(G) \\le \\Delta$, the largest clique in $G$ has size $\\le \\Delta$. Indeed, $16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{d} + 10 \\ge 16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta}{16\\ln(n)} = \\Delta$.\nSimilarly, if $\\Delta \\le d$, then take $H = G$. The largest clique size is 1 and $\\Delta(H) \\le \\Delta \\le d$. Finally, if $n \\le 10$, then the largest clique size is at most 10, so we can let $S$ be the empty graph as well.\nIt remains to prove the lemma for $n > 10$ and $16 \\ln(n) < d < \\Delta$. We choose $S$ by sampling each edge in $G$ with probability $d/(2\\Delta)$. For any vertex $v$, we let $X_1, \\dots, X_{\\deg(v)}$ be indicator variables for whether an incident edge is chosen. If we let $X := \\sum_{i=1}^{\\deg(v)} X_i$, then $E[X] \\le d/2$. By Proposition 2.2 with $\\epsilon = 1$,\n$$ \\Pr(X > d) \\le \\Pr(X > 2 \\cdot E[X]) \\le \\exp(-\\frac{d}{4}) < \\exp(-\\frac{16\\ln n}{8}) = \\exp(-2\\ln n). $$\nHence, by a union bound, Pr(Some vertex in $H$ has degree greater than $d$) does not exceed\n$$ n \\cdot \\exp(-2\\ln n) = \\exp(\\ln n - 2\\ln n) = \\exp(-\\ln n) = \\frac{1}{n}. $$\nFinally, we calculate the probability that this procedure yields a subgraph $H$ satisfying Item 1 and Item 2. Through a union bound on the complement, when $n > 10$, we get\n$$ \\Pr(H \\text{ does not satisfy Item 1 or Item 2}) \\le \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{100} < 1. $$\nThus, there is some $H$ satisfying the two conditions.",
