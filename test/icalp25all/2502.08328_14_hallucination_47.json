For any given set $S$ with size $\\xi n \\le |S| \\le (1-\\xi)n$, the sum of degrees $\\text{deg}_G(S)$ is a sum of contributions from edges internal to $S$ and edges connecting $S$ to $\\bar{S}$. Let $X = 2|E_G(S)|$ and $Y = |E_G(S, \\bar{S})|$. $X$ and $Y$ are independent, as they depend on disjoint sets of potential edges.\n\nFor the average degree $\\text{deg}_G(S)/|S|$ to be less than $(1-\\varepsilon)d$, it is necessary that both the internal and external contributions to the degree are smaller than their expectations. Let $A$ be the event that $X < (1-\\varepsilon)E[X]$ and $B$ be the event that $Y < (1-\\varepsilon)E[Y]$. The event of low average degree implies that $A \\cap B$ must occur.\n\nFirst, we bound the probability of $A$. The random variable $|E_G(S)|$ follows a $\\text{Bin}(\\binom{|S|}{2}, d/n)$ distribution. Its mean is $\\mu_X = \\binom{|S|}{2}d/n \\ge \\binom{\\xi n}{2}d/n \\approx d\\xi^2 n/2$. By the Chernoff bound, $P(A) \\le \\exp(-\\varepsilon^2 \\mu_X/2) \\le \\exp(-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2 n/4)$.\n\nSecond, for the external edges, $Y \\sim \\text{Bin}(|S|(n-|S|), d/n)$. The mean is $\\mu_Y = |S|(n-|S|)d/n \\ge \\xi n(1-\\xi)n d/n = d\\xi(1-\\xi)n$. By the Chernoff bound, $P(B) \\le \\exp(-\\varepsilon^2 \\mu_Y/2) \\le \\exp(-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi(1-\\xi)n/2)$.\n\nSince the events $A$ and $B$ are independent, the probability of a given set $S$ having a low average degree is $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B) \\le \\exp(-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi^2 n/4) \\cdot \\exp(-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi(1-\\xi)n/2) = \\exp(-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi n ( \\xi/4 + (1-\\xi)/2))$.\n\nThere are at most $2^n$ such sets $S$. By a union bound, the probability of any such set existing is at most $2^n \\exp(-d\\varepsilon^2\\xi n (\\xi/4 + (1-\\xi)/2)) = \\exp(n(\\ln 2 - d\\varepsilon^2\\xi(\\xi/4 + (1-\\xi)/2)))$.\nFor $d > \\frac{32 \\log 2}{\\xi^2}$, this expression is $\\exp(-\\Omega(n)) = o(1)$. Thus, whp, no such set $S$ exists.",
