  "proof": "Proof. Here, $k > 0$ will be a sufficiently large constant we specify later.\nFix $1 \\le s \\le \\log n$. We union bound over connected trees of size $s$ and events “$T$ is a subtree of $G$ with $e(V(T)) > s - 1 + k$”. Fix any tree $T$ of size $s$. Then note that conditional on $T$ being a subgraph of $G$, we have that $e(V(T)) \\sim s - 1 + \\text{Bin}(\\binom{s}{2} - (s-1), d/n) \\le s + \\text{Bin}(s^2, d/n)$.\nWe have $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Bin}(s^2, d/n) \\ge k) \\le s^{2k}(d/n)^k$ by union bound.\nThen union bound over $\\log n$ possible sizes and then using Markov inequality gives probability $\\le \\log n/\\sqrt{n} = o(1)$.",
