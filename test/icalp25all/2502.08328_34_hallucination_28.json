  "proof": "Proof. Consider arbitrary $F \\in B_1$. As we saw in Case 0 of the proof of Lemma 53, the number of singleton components in $(V_C, F)$ is at most $(1 - \\frac{2\\eta}{3})n$. Let $S$ be the set of vertices that are in components of size $\\ge 2$.\nNote that the edges of $F$ have all endpoints in $S$, thus $|F| \\le e_G(S)$. Combining Lemmas 29, 30 (with $R$ being the $k$ from the previous lemma) and 35, we get for all $d$ large enough, whp, for any connected subset $S' \\subseteq S$ of $(V_C, F)$, $e_G(S') \\le |S'|(1+\\max(1, d\\eta/3))$. Since $S$ is partitioned by its connected components $S_i$ in the graph $(V_C, F)$, the edges of $G$ within $S$ are only those within each $S_i$. Thus, we can sum the bounds on each component, yielding $e_G(S) = \\sum_i e_G(S_i) \\le \\sum_i |S_i|(1+\\max(1, d\\eta/3)) = |S|(1+\\max(1, d\\eta/3))$. Since $e_G(S) \\ge |F| \\ge \\frac{9\\eta}{10}|E_C|$, we must have $|S| \\ge \\frac{9\\eta|E_C|}{10d(\\eta/3+1/d)}$. Since each component containing $|S|$ has at least 2 vertices, $c(F) \\le n - |S| + |S|/2 = n - |S|/2$. Therefore we can bound\n$$ \\frac{w_G(F)}{w_G(\\emptyset)} = q^{c(F)-n_c}(e^\\beta-1)^{|F|} \\le q^{n-\\frac{9\\eta|E_C|}{20d(\\eta/3+1/d)}-n_c} (e^\\beta-1)^{\\frac{9}{10}\\eta|E_C|} \\le q^{-\\frac{9\\eta|E_C|}{10d}(\\frac{1}{2(\\eta/3+1/d)}-21)}, $$\nwhere the last inequality follows from $\\beta \\le \\beta_1$ and that whp $n_c \\ge n(1-e^{-d/3})$. For all $d$ large enough $\\frac{1}{2(\\eta/3+1/d)} - 21 > 1$. By Lemma 39, whp $|E_C| \\ge \\frac{dn}{2} - 2ne^{-d/3} \\ge \\frac{dn}{3}$, giving that $\\frac{w_G(F)}{Z_C^{\\mathrm{dis}}} \\le q^{-n[\\eta/20-e^{-d/3}]}$. For all $d$ large enough, this is at most $q^{-n\\eta/30}$. Aggregating over at most $2^{|E_C|} \\le 2^{dn}$ configurations $F$, we get that $\\pi_C^{\\mathrm{dis}}(B_1) \\le e^{-n}$ for all $q$ large enough.",
