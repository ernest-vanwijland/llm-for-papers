  "proof": "To prove the statement, we will establish the stronger result that the collection of graphs $\\{H_i : i \\in [k]\\} \\cup \\{R_{i+1} : i \\in [k]\\}$ is disjoint. For any given $i \\in [k]$, we can see from Lemma 3.4 that $H_{\\text{Base}}(i) \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$ and from Lemma 3.5 that $R_{i+1} \\subseteq H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i) \\subseteq H_{\\text{Base}}(i) \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$. It follows that both $H_i$ and $R_{i+1}$ are contained within $G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$ as subgraphs.\n\nFirst, we argue that for a given $i$, the graphs $H_i$ and $R_{i+1}$ are edge-disjoint. Specifically, because $H_i$ is drawn from the support of $\\text{supp}(\\mathcal{H}_i)$ such that $\\Phi_i(H_i) = M_i$, it is true by definition that no edge belonging to $H_i$ can be found in $H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)$. However, since $R_{i+1}$ is a subgraph of $H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)$, it must be that no edge from $R_{i+1}$ is present in $H_i$.\n\nNext, we demonstrate that $G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$ shares no edges with either $H_i$ or $R_{i+1}$. Consider any edge in $H_i$; this edge is part of $H_{\\text{Base}}(i)$ but not part of $H_{\\text{Miss}}(i)$. Consequently, this edge is not in the graph $G_{\\text{Base}}(i) - (H_{\\text{Base}}(i) - H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i))$. Now consider $R_{i+1}$. According to Lemma 3.5, its edges are not incident to any vertex in the set $Q_i$. Therefore, no edge from $R_{i+1}$ can be in $G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$, which is defined as the subgraph $(G_{\\text{Base}}(i) - (H_{\\text{Base}}(i) - H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)))[Q_i]$ induced by $Q_i$.\n\nFinally, for any index $j$ greater than $i$, the graphs are nested such that $G_{\\text{Base}}(j) \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$. As a result, if we take any edge $(u,v)$ from either $H_i$ or $R_{i+1}$, we can conclude that $(u,v)$ is not in $G_{\\text{Base}}(j)$, because we have already shown it is not in $G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$. Given that both $H_j$ and $R_{j+1}$ are subgraphs of $G_{\\text{Base}}(j)$, the edge $(u,v)$ cannot be present in $H_j$ or $R_{j+1}$.\n\nThis shows that an edge belonging to $H_i$ or $R_{i+1}$ (and it can only be in one of them) will not be part of any graph $H_j$ or $R_{j+1}$ for any $j > i$. This establishes that the set $\\{H_i : i \\in [k]\\} \\cup \\{R_{i+1} : i \\in [k]\\}$ is indeed edge-disjoint. Because $R_1$ is an empty graph, this collection encompasses all graphs that are sent to the players. It follows that no two players are given the same edge.",
