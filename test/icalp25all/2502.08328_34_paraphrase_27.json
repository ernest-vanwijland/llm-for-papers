  "proof": "Let us consider an arbitrary configuration $F \\in B_1$. As established in Case 0 of the proof of Lemma 53, the number of components in $(V_c, F)$ that consist of a single vertex is no more than $(1 - \\frac{2\\eta}{3})n$. We will define $S$ to be the set of vertices that are part of components with a size of at least 2.\n\nObserve that all endpoints of the edges in $F$ must lie within $S$, and therefore $|F| \\le e_G(S)$. By combining Lemmas 29, 30 (setting $R$ to be the value $k$ from that lemma), and 35, we find that for any sufficiently large $d$, it holds with high probability that for every connected subset $S' \\subseteq S$ of $(V_c, F)$, the inequality $e_G(S') \\le |S'|(1+\\max(1, d\\eta/3))$ is satisfied. From this, it follows that $e_G(S) \\le |S|(2+d\\eta/3)$. Because we have $e_G(S) \\ge |F| \\ge \\frac{9\\eta}{10}|E_c|$, it must be the case that $|S| \\ge \\frac{9\\eta|E_c|}{10d(\\eta/3+2/d)}$. Since every component involving vertices from $S$ contains at least 2 vertices, the total number of components is $c(F) \\le n - |S| + |S|/2 = n - |S|/2$. Consequently, we can establish the following bound:\n$$\n\\frac{w_G(F)}{w_G(\\emptyset)} = q^{c(F)-n_c}(e^\\beta-1)^{|F|} \\le q^{n-\\frac{|S|}{2}-n_c}(e^\\beta-1)^{|F|} \\le q^{n-\\frac{9\\eta|E_c|}{20d(\\eta/3+2/d)}-n_c}(e^\\beta-1)^{|F|} \\le q^{-\\frac{9\\eta|E_c|}{10d}(\\frac{1}{2(\\eta/3+2/d)}-21)}\n$$\nHere, the last inequality is derived from the condition $\\beta \\le \\beta_1$ and the fact that, with high probability, $n_c \\ge n(1-e^{-d/3})$. For any sufficiently large $d$, the term $\\frac{9}{2(\\eta/3+2/d)}-21$ is greater than 1. By applying Lemma 39, we know that with high probability, $|E_c| \\ge \\frac{dn}{2}-2ne^{-d/3} \\ge \\frac{dn}{3}$. This leads to the inequality $\\frac{w_G(F)}{Z_c^{\\mathrm{dis}}} \\le q^{-n[\\eta/20-e^{-d/3}]}$. For all sufficiently large $d$, this value is at most $q^{-n\\eta/30}$. Finally, by summing over the at most $2^{|E_c|} \\le 2^{dn}$ possible configurations for $F$, we conclude that for all sufficiently large $q$, $\\pi_c^{\\mathrm{dis}}(B_1) \\le e^{-\\Omega(n)}$.",
