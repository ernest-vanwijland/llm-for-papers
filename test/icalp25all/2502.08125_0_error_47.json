  "proof": "Proof. We show the lemma by induction on i. For i = 0, i.e., x = 0 or x = m, we obtain the exact distance for every vertex.\n\nFirst, we show that $d^x(v) \\le \\hat{d}^x(v)$. If v is dead in subproblem x, then $\\hat{d}^x(v) = \\hat{d}^l(v)$, where l is the start of the interval of node x in the recursion tree. So, the level of l is smaller than i. By induction, $\\hat{d}^l(v) \\le d^l(v)$. Also, since $l < x$, we have $d^x(v) \\le d^l(v)$. Therefore, $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\le d^l(v) \\le d^x(v) = d^x(v)$. So, we can assume v is alive. Let $p = s, v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k$ be the shortest path from s to $v = v_k$ in $G_x$, so $\\hat{d}^x(v)$ is the length of p rounded up to the nearest integer power of $1 + \\epsilon / \\log m$. Note that the path $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k$ exists in $G'_x$ as well, since all the edges that only appear in $G'_x$ start at s. If the edge $(s, v_1)$ is present in $G'_x$, then $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\le d^x(v)$, as p is a path from s to v in $G'_x$, which means that $d'_{G'_x}(v)$, the length of the shortest path in $G'_x$ from s to v, is at most the length of p. Otherwise, there exists an edge $(u, v_1)$ in $G_x$, such that u is dead at time x, and the edge $(s, v_1)$ has weight $\\hat{d}^l(u) + w(u, v_1)$. As shown above, since u is dead at time x, we have $\\hat{d}^l(u) \\ge d^l(u)$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\hat{d}^x(v) \\ge \\hat{d}^l(u) + w(u, v_1) + d_{G_x}(v_1, v) \\ge d^l(u) + w(u, v_1) + d_{G_x}(v_1, v) \\ge d^x(v).\n$$\nNext, we show that $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\le d^x(v)(1 + \\epsilon / \\log m)^i$. Let q be the shortest path from s to v in $G_x$. If q is also present in $G'_x$, it follows that $\\hat{d}^x(v) \\le d^x(v)(1 + \\epsilon / \\log m)$. Otherwise, let $(a, b)$ be the last edge in q that does not exist in $G'_x$. Thus, either a or b is not alive in $G_x$.\n\nFirst, let’s assume b is not alive in $G_x$. Thus b must be the last vertex in q—if there were an edge $(b, c)$ in q, this edge would exist in $G'_x$, so b would be alive in $G_x$ (note that $b \\ne s$). Since b is the last vertex in q, and $v = b$ is dead in $G_x$, it follows that\n$$\n\\hat{d}^x(v) = \\hat{d}^r(v) \\le d^r(v)(1 + \\epsilon / \\log m)^{i-1} < d^x(v)(1 + \\epsilon / \\log m)^{i-1},\n$$\nwhere r is the end of the interval of node x in the recursion tree. The first inequality follows from the induction hypothesis and the fact that the level of r is strictly less than i, and the second inequality is because $x \\le r$ and adding more edges can only decrease the distance of each node from s.\n\nOtherwise, assume b is alive in $G_x$, which means that a is dead in $G_x$. Thus, there is an edge $(s, b)$ in $G'_x$ with weight $\\hat{d}^r(a) + w(a, b) = d^r(a) + w(a, b)$. Prepending this edge to the suffix of q beginning at b results in a path in $G'_x$ from s to v of length $d^r(a) + w(a, b) + d_{G_x}(b, v)$. Since the level of r is less than x, by the induction hypothesis we have $d^r(a) \\le d^r(a)(1 + \\epsilon / \\log m)^{i-1}$. Hence,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{d}^x(v) &\\le (d^r(a) + w(a, b) + d_{G_x}(b, v))(1 + \\epsilon / \\log m) \\\\\n&\\le (d^r(a)(1 + \\epsilon / \\log m)^{i-1} + w(a, b) + d_{G_x}(b, v))(1 + \\epsilon / \\log m) \\\\\n&\\le (d^x(a)(1 + \\epsilon / \\log m)^{i-1} + w(a, b) + d_{G_x}(b, v))(1 + \\epsilon / \\log m) \\\\\n&= (d^x(a) + w(a, b) + d_{G_x}(b, v))(1 + \\epsilon / \\log m)^i \\\\\n&= d^x(v)(1 + \\epsilon / \\log m)^i.\n\\end{align*}",
