  "proof": "Because $C(u) = C(v)$, there must be at least $|N(u)\\Delta N(v)|$ disagreements incident to the vertices $u$ and $v$. Consequently, for any edge $uv \\in \\varphi_2^+$, the combined cost for $u$ and $v$ satisfies the relation $\\text{cost}_C(u) + \\text{cost}_C(v) \\ge |N(u)\\Delta N(v)| \\ge \\beta \\cdot M_{uv}$.",
