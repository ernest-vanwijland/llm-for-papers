  "proof": "Let $k > 0$ be a constant, which we will choose to be sufficiently large later in the proof. We fix a size $s$ such that $1 \\le s \\le \\log n$. Our approach is to use a union bound over all connected trees of size $s$ and the event that such a tree $T$ is a subgraph of $G$ where the number of edges within its vertex set, $e(V(T))$, exceeds $s - 1 + k$.\n\nFor any given tree $T$ of size $s$, conditional on $T$ being a subgraph of $G$, the number of edges within its vertex set $V(T)$ is distributed as $s - 1 + \\text{Bin}(\\binom{s}{2} - (s-1), d/n)$. This can be bounded above by $s + \\text{Bin}(s^2, d/n)$.\n\nBy applying a union bound, the probability that a binomial random variable $\\text{Bin}(s^2, d/n)$ is at least $k$ can be bounded as $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Bin}(s^2, d/n) \\ge k) \\le s^{2k}(d/n)^k$. According to Lemma 31, the expected number of connected trees of size $s$ is no more than $n(ed)^s$. Consequently, the expected number of subtrees $T$ in $G$ of size $s$ that have at least $s-1+k$ edges within $V(T)$ is bounded above by:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{ds^2}{n}\\right)^k n(ed)^s = n \\exp\\{s \\log(ed) + k \\log(\\frac{ds^2}{n})\\} \\le d^k n \\exp\\{\\log(ed)\\log n - k \\log(\\frac{n}{\\log^2 n})\\} $$\nFor any choice of $k > \\log(ed) + 2$, this expression is at most $\\frac{d^k}{n}$ for all sufficiently large $n$.\n\nBy taking a union bound over the $\\log n$ possible values for the size $s$ and then applying Markov's inequality, we find the probability is at most $\\log n/\\sqrt{n}$, which simplifies to $o(1)$.",
