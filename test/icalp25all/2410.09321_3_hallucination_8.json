  "proof": "Proof. Since $C(u) = C(v)$, we can relate the cost to the symmetric difference of the neighborhoods. As the cardinality of the symmetric difference, $|N(u)\\Delta N(v)|$, is a metric, any node $w \\in N(u)\\Delta N(v)$ must have $C(w) \\neq C(u)$. Thus, there are at least $|N(u)\\Delta N(v)|$ disagreements incident to $u$ and $v$. For every $uv \\in \\varphi_2^+$, we have $\\text{cost}_C(u) + \\text{cost}_C(v) \\ge |N(u)\\Delta N(v)| \\ge \\beta \\cdot M_{uv}$.",
