  "proof": "Proof. For each $v \\in A$, either $v \\in G_{Base}(k + 1)$ or $v \\in P$ for some $i \\in [k]$ and $P \\in \\mathcal{P}_i$. We let $L_i := \\cup_{P \\in \\mathcal{P}_i} P$. Since $n_k < \\frac{3n}{\\Delta^2}$, more than $\\frac{n(96\\ell^2 \\ln(n)+30)}{\\Delta^2}$ vertices in $A$ are also in $L_1 \\cup \\dots \\cup L_k$. By the Pigeonhole principle, for some $i \\in [k]$, we have $|L_i \\cap A| > \\frac{n(96\\ell^2 \\ln(n)+30)}{\\Delta^2}$. Since $\\mathcal{P}_i$ is a partition of the vertices in $L_i$, and since $|\\mathcal{P}_i| \\le \\frac{3n}{\\Delta^2}$ by Lemma 4.4, there is some $P = (V_P, E_P) \\in \\mathcal{P}_i$ such that $|P \\cap A| > 32\\ell^2 \\ln(n) + 10$ (again, by the Pigeonhole principle).\n\nBy Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5, the largest clique in $(H_{Miss}(M_i) - R_{i+1})[P]$ has size at most\n$$16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{d_{filter}}{d_{removal}} + 10 = 16 \\cdot \\frac{\\ell^2\\Delta}{\\Delta/2} \\cdot \\ln(n) + 10 = 64\\ell^2 \\ln(n) + 10.$$\nThus, there is some $u, v \\in P$ such that $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(M_i) - R_{i+1}$.\nIf $(u, v) \\in R_{i+1}$, then we send the same graph and edges. Note that $R_{k+1} = \\emptyset$ since $n_k < \\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$. Thus, Player $i+1$ exists and will receive $R_{i+1}$. As such, there is an edge between $(u, v)$ in $G_{input}$.\nOtherwise, we know there is some $j \\in [i]$ s.t. $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(j)$ but $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(M_j)$. We prove this with two cases:\nIf $(u, v) \\in G_{Base}(i)$, then let $j = i$. Since $H_{Base}(i)[P] = G_{Base}(i)[P]$, we have $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(i)$. Additionally, since $(u, v) \\notin R_{i+1}$, we know that $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(M_j)$ as well.\nOtherwise, $(u, v) \\notin G_{Base}(i)$. Since $G_{Base}(i) \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq G_{Base}(1)$ and $(u, v) \\in G_{Base}(1)$, we can find some $j < i$ s.t. $(u, v) \\in G_{Base}(j)$ but $(u, v) \\notin G_{Base}(j+1)$. In particular,\n$$(u, v) \\notin G_{Base}(j+1) = (G_{Base}(j) - (H_{Base}(j) - H_{Miss}(M_j)))[Q_j].$$\nSince $u, v \\in G_{Base}(i)$ and all vertices in $G_{Base}(i)$ are also in $Q_j$, we know that $u, v \\in Q_j$. This allows us to conclude that\n$$(u, v) \\notin G_{Base}(j) - (H_{Base}(j) - H_{Miss}(M_j)).$$\nWe know that $(u, v) \\in G_{Base}(j)$, so we must also have $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(j) - H_{Miss}(M_j)$. Hence, $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(j)$ and $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(M_j)$.\n\nSince $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(j)$, and $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(j)$, there is some graph $H' \\in \\mathcal{H}_j$ such that $(u, v) \\in H'$ and $\\Phi_j(H') = M_j$. We substitute $H_j$ with $H'$ when choosing $G_{input}$ and the edges we send each player. Each player sends the same message, but $(u, v) \\in G'_{input}$, concluding the proof.",
