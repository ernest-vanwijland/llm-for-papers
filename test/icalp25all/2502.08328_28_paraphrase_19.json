  "proof": "For the first part of the statement, we begin by expanding the right-hand side using the definition of a polymer's weight:\n$$ q^{n_c} \\prod_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{dis}}(F)} w^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma) = q^{n_c + |\\Gamma^{\\mathrm{dis}}(F)| - \\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{dis}}(F)} |V_G(\\gamma)|} (e^\\beta - 1)^{\\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{dis}}(F)} e_G(\\gamma)} $$\nBy definition, the disordered polymers of $F$ are the connected components of the graph $(V_C, F)$. This means the number of polymers, $|\\Gamma^{\\mathrm{dis}}(F)|$, is equal to $c(F)$, the number of connected components. Also, summing the number of vertices over all polymers, $\\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{dis}}(F)} |V_G(\\gamma)|$, gives the total number of vertices, $n_c$. Moreover, since every edge in $F$ is contained in a single polymer and the polymers do not overlap, the sum of the edges in each polymer, $\\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{dis}}(F)} e_G(\\gamma)$, must equal the total number of edges, $|F|$. Plugging these identities back into the expanded expression confirms the first part of the lemma.\n\nProceeding to the second part, we note that any disordered polymer with no edges has a weight of 1. Therefore, for any polymer of the form $\\gamma = (\\{v\\}, \\emptyset)$, the inequality presented in the lemma is trivial. Let us then suppose that $\\gamma$ is a polymer containing at least one edge. Consider any $F \\in \\Omega^{\\mathrm{dis}}$ for which $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{dis}}(F)$. We can define $F' := F \\setminus E_G(\\gamma)$, and we observe that $F' \\ne F$. The components of the graph $(V_C, F')$ are identical to the components of $(V_C, F)$, with the exception of the vertices of $\\gamma$. These vertices, which constitute the polymer $\\gamma$ in $(V_C, F)$, are instead isolated vertices in $(V_C, F')$. As a result, the weight of $F'$ is related to the weight of $F$ by the equation $w_C(F') = w_C(F)q^{|V_G(\\gamma)|-1}(e^\\beta-1)^{-e_G(\\gamma)}$, which simplifies to $w_C(F)/w^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma)$.\nLet $\\Omega^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma) = \\{F \\in \\Omega^{\\mathrm{dis}} \\mid \\gamma \\in \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{dis}}(F)\\}$. We can then write\n$$ \\pi_C^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma \\in \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\cdot)) = \\frac{\\sum_{F \\in \\Omega^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma)} w_C(F)}{\\sum_{F \\in \\Omega^{\\mathrm{dis}}} w_C(F)} \\le \\frac{\\sum_{F \\in \\Omega^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma)} w_C(F)}{\\sum_{F \\in \\Omega^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma)} (w_C(F) + w_C(F'))} \\le \\frac{1}{1+1/w^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma)} \\le w^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma). $$",
