Write\n$$ q(e^\\beta - 1)^{|E_C|} \\prod_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_v^{\\text{ord}}(F)} w_v^{\\text{ord}}(\\gamma) = q^{1+\\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_v^{\\text{ord}}(F)} c'(\\gamma)} (e^\\beta - 1)^{|E_C|-\\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_v^{\\text{ord}}(F)} e_{\\text{out}}(\\gamma)} $$\nEvery out-edge of $F$ is in exactly one ordered polymer of $F$, thus $|E_C \\setminus F| = \\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_v^{\\text{ord}}(F)} e_{\\text{out}}(\\gamma)$. It remains to show that $c(F) = 1 + \\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_v^{\\text{ord}}(F)} c'(\\gamma)$.\nBy Lemma 16 whp $G$ is such that for all $F \\in \\Omega_C^{\\text{ord}}$, $(V_C, F)$ contains a giant component with total degree $> \\frac{1}{2}\\text{deg}_G(G_C)$. The 1-term in the above equality corresponds to the giant. Now consider any non-giant component $\\kappa$ of $(V_C, F)$. Its vertices must be in $V(v, F)$, and thus in $V_\\gamma$ for some $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_v^{\\text{ord}}(F)$, hence also $E_C(V(\\kappa), V(\\kappa)) \\subseteq E_{\\text{out}}(\\gamma)$. Since $\\kappa$ is connected in $(V_C, F)$, it must be connected in $(V_C, E_C \\setminus E_{\\text{out}}(\\gamma))$, as $F \\subseteq E_C \\setminus E_{\\text{out}}(\\gamma)$, thus it is accounted for in $c'(\\gamma)$. Therefore $1 + c(F) \\le 1 + \\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_v^{\\text{ord}}(F)} c'(\\gamma)$.\nNow consider $\\kappa$ to be a non-giant component of $(V_C, E_C \\setminus E_{\\text{out}}(\\gamma))$ for some $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_v^{\\text{ord}}(F)$. Since $(V_C, E_C)$ is connected, $E_{\\text{out}}(\\gamma)$ contains an out-edge $e$ incident to some vertex $w$ of $\\kappa$. Since $F \\subseteq E_C \\setminus E_{\\text{out}}(\\gamma)$, the component of $w$ in $(V_C, F)$, $\\kappa'$, must be a subgraph of $\\kappa$. Clearly, $\\kappa'$ must also be non-giant, thus all of its vertices are in $V(v, F)$. Since non-singleton polymers are maximal connected subgraphs consisting of vertices in $V(v, F)$, there is a unique polymer $\\gamma'$ containing vertices in $V(\\kappa') \\subseteq V(\\kappa)$. Since $e$ is an out-edge incident to $w$, $e \\in E_{\\text{out}}(\\gamma')$. Thus $e$ is not in a singleton polymer in $\\Gamma_v^{\\text{ord}}(F)$, so $\\gamma$ must be a non-singleton polymer with an endpoint of $e$ contained in $V_\\gamma$. But then $V_\\gamma \\cup \\{w\\}$ is a connected subset in $(V_C, E_C)$, and thus in particular so is $V_\\gamma \\cup V_{\\gamma'}$. Since polymers of $F$ do not intersect, it must be the case $\\gamma = \\gamma'$. As vertex sets of components are convex sets in the graph metric, and both $\\kappa$ and $\\kappa'$ are maximal connected subgraphs, the inclusion $V(\\kappa') \\subseteq V(\\kappa)$ implies they must be identical, so $\\kappa = \\kappa'$. Thus each non-giant component $\\kappa$ of $(V_C, E_C \\setminus E_{\\text{out}}(\\gamma))$ for any $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_v^{\\text{ord}}(F)$ is also a non-giant component of $(V_C, E_C)$ and for any $\\gamma' \\in \\Gamma_v^{\\text{ord}}(F)$, $\\gamma' \\neq \\gamma$, $\\kappa$ is not a non-giant component of $(V_C, E_C \\setminus E_{\\text{out}}(\\gamma'))$. This finished the second part of the equality and thus the proof.",
