  "proof": "Proof. Fix $\\tau$. Let $h_t$ be the number of edges in $\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)$ that have arrived by time $t$.\n\nNow, fix a position $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$. At each time $t$, either no jump happens, or some edge jumps from position $t' > t$ to position $t$. Consider the first time $t^*$ an edge $e \\in \\text{LOW}(\\tau)$ jumps over $i$. We want to show that $t^*$ cannot be “much smaller” than $i$. Assume this jump is from position $t' > i$ to position $t^* < i$. So, the position of $e$ at time $t^* - 1$ in the updated prediction is $t'$, i.e., $\\text{index}_{t^*-1}(e) = t'$. Also, the actual position of $e$ is $t^*$, i.e., $\\text{index}(e) = t^*$. We know that\n$$ t' - t^* = \\text{index}_{t^*-1}(e) - \\text{index}(e) \\le \\tau + h_{t^*-1} \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|, $$\nwhich means that $i - t^* < t' - t^* \\le \\tau + |\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.\n\nBefore time $t^*$, all the edges that might have jumped over $i$ are in $\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)$. So there are at most $|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$ jumps over $i$ before time $t^*$. Also, after time $i$, no edge can jump over $i$. Therefore, the total number of jumps over $i$ is at most $|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)| + (i - t^* + 1) \\le \\tau + 2|\\text{HIGH}(\\tau)|$.",
