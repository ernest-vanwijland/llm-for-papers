  "proof": "Proof. We have that whp $|E_C| < \\frac{dn}{2} + ne^{-d/3}$ and $|E_K| \\ge \\frac{dn}{2} - 2ne^{-d/3}$. Thus\n$$ \\frac{|E_C|}{|E_K|} \\le \\frac{d/2+e^{-d/3}}{d/2-2e^{-d/3}}. $$\nFor large $d$, the term $2e^{-d/3}$ is negligible compared to $d/2$. We can therefore replace the denominator with its asymptotic value $d/2$, which gives\n$$ \\frac{|E_C|}{|E_K|} \\le \\frac{d/2+e^{-d/3}}{d/2} = 1 + \\frac{2e^{-d/3}}{d}. $$\nFor all $d$ large enough, $\\frac{2}{d} \\le 1$, hence giving that $|E_C|$ is at most $(1+e^{-d/3})|E_K|$.",
