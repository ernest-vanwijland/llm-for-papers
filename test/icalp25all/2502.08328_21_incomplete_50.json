  "proof": "Proof. We have that whp $|E_C| < \\frac{dn}{2} + ne^{-d/3}$ (since $|E_C| \\le |E_G| = \\frac{nd}{2} + o(n)$) and $|E_K| \\ge \\frac{dn}{2} - 2ne^{-d/3}$ (by previous lemma). For all d large enough, $\\frac{3}{d/2-2e^{-d/3}} \\le 1$, hence giving that $|E_C|$ is at most $(1+e^{-d/3})|E_K|$.",
