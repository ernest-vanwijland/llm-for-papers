  "proof": "Proof. For each $v \\in A$, either $v \\in G_{Base}(k + 1)$ or $v \\in P$ for some $i \\in [k]$ and $P \\in \\mathcal{P}_i$. We let $L_i := \\cup_{P \\in \\mathcal{P}_i} P$. Since $n_k < \\frac{3n}{\\Delta^2}$, more than $\\frac{n(96\\ell^2 \\ln(n)+30)}{\\Delta^2}$ vertices in $A$ are also in $L_1 \\cup \\dots \\cup L_k$. By the Pigeonhole principle, for some $i \\in [k]$, we have $|L_i \\cap A| > \\frac{n(96\\ell^2 \\ln(n)+30)}{\\Delta^2}$. Since $\\mathcal{P}_i$ is a partition of the vertices in $L_i$, and since $|\\mathcal{P}_i| \\le \\frac{3n}{\\Delta^2}$ by Lemma 4.4, there is some $P = (V_P, E_P) \\in \\mathcal{P}_i$ such that $|P \\cap A| > 32\\ell^2 \\ln(n) + 10$ (again, by the Pigeonhole principle).\n\nBy Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5, the largest clique in $(H_{Miss}(M_i) - R_{i+1})[P]$ has size at most\n$$16\\ln(n) \\cdot \\frac{d_{filter}}{d_{removal}} + 10 = 16 \\cdot \\frac{\\ell^2\\Delta}{\\Delta/2} \\cdot \\ln(n) + 10 = 32\\ell^2 \\ln(n) + 10.$$\nThus, there is some $u, v \\in P$ such that $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(M_i) - R_{i+1}$.\n\nSince $(u, v) \\notin H_{Miss}(j)$, and $(u, v) \\in H_{Base}(j)$, there is some graph $H' \\in \\mathcal{H}_j$ such that $(u, v) \\in H'$ and $\\Phi_j(H') = M_j$. We substitute $H_j$ with $H'$ when choosing $G_{input}$ and the edges we send each player. Each player sends the same message, but $(u, v) \\in G'_{input}$, concluding the proof.",
