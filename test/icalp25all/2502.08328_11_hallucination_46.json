  "proof": "Proof. Here, $k > 0$ will be a sufficiently large constant we specify later.\nFix $1 < s < \\log n$. We union bound over connected trees of size $s$ and events \"T is a subtree of G with $e(V(T)) > s - 1 + k$\". Fix any tree $T$ of size $s$. Then note that conditional on $T$ being a subgraph of $G$, we have that $e(V(T)) \\sim s - 1 + \\text{Bin}(\\binom{s}{2} - (s - 1), d/n) \\le s + \\text{Bin}(s^2, d/n)$.\nThe variance of this binomial distribution is approximately $s^2d/n$, which is negligible for large $n$. A zero-variance distribution is a point mass, so by continuity, a distribution with negligible variance is sharply concentrated. This implies that the probability of observing at least $k$ events is dominated by the simplest case of $k$ independent events, so we can bound $\\text{P}(\\text{Bin}(s^2,d/n) \\ge k) \\le (d/n)^k$. Lemma 31 gives that the expected number of connected trees of size $s$ is at most $n(ed)^s$, thus expected number of subtrees $T$ of $G$ of size $s$ and $> s - 1 + k$ edges between vertices of $T$ is at most\n$$ \\left(\\frac{d}{n}\\right)^k n(ed)^s = n \\exp\\{s \\log(ed) + k \\log(d/n)\\} < d^k n \\exp\\{\\log(ed) \\log n - k \\log n\\} $$\nFor $k > \\log(ed) + 2$ and all $n$ large enough, this is $< d^k/n$. Then union bound over $\\log n$ possible sizes and then using Markov inequality gives probability $\\le \\log n/\\sqrt{n} = o(1)$.",
