  "proof": "Proof. Assume we have some $A > 0$ for now. We use Markov inequality on the expected number of subtrees of $G$, $T$ with $\\frac{A \\log n}{d} < |V_G(T)| \\le \\xi n$ (as every connected set has a spanning tree). Thus it is enough to show\n$$ \\sum_{\\substack{T \\text{ a tree} \\\\ \\frac{A \\log n}{d} < |V_G(T)| \\le \\xi n}} P(e_G(V_G(T)) \\ge (\\xi d + 1)|V_G(T)| | T \\text{ a subtree of } G)P(T \\text{ a subtree of } G) = o(1) $$\nFix a tree $T$ with $s$ vertices. Then conditional on $T$ being a subgraph of $G$, $e_G(V(T)) \\sim s-1 + \\text{Bin}(\\binom{s}{2} - (s-1), d/n)$. Since $\\binom{s}{2} - s - 1 < s^2/2$, we can bound\n$$ P(e_G(V_G(T)) \\ge (2\\xi d/3 + 1)s | T \\text{ a subtree of } G) \\le P(\\text{Bin}(s^2/2, d/n) \\ge 2\\xi ds/3). $$\nNoting that $s < \\xi n$, Chernoff bound gives that this is at most $\\exp\\{-\\xi ds/216\\}$.\nBy Lemma 31, the expected number of subtrees of size $s$ is at most $n s^{s-2}$. Hence summing over possible subtree sizes, we get that the expected number of \"bad\" subtrees is at most\n$$ \\sum_{\\frac{A \\log n}{d} < s \\le \\xi n} n s^{s-2} \\exp\\{-\\xi ds/216\\}. $$\nLet $f(s) = s^{s-2} e^{-\\xi ds/216}$. For large $d$, this function is decreasing for $s$ in the given range. Thus the sum is at most its first term times the number of terms:\n$$ \\xi n \\cdot n (s_{min})^{s_{min}-2} \\exp\\{-\\xi d s_{min}/216\\} \\quad \\text{where } s_{min} = \\frac{A \\log n}{d}. $$\nThis is equal to $\\xi n^2 \\exp\\{(s_{min}-2)\\log s_{min} - \\xi d s_{min}/216\\}$.\nSubstituting $s_{min}$, the exponent becomes $(A \\log n/d - 2)\\log(A \\log n/d) - A\\xi \\log n/216$.\nSince $\\log(A \\log n/d)$ grows much slower than $\\log n$, the dominant term in the exponent is $-A\\xi \\log n/216$. Thus the expression is bounded by $n^{2 - A\\xi/216 + o(1)}$, which is $o(1)$ for any $A > 432/\\xi$.",
