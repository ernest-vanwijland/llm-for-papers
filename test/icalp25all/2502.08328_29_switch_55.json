  "proof": "Proof. Also by union bound and Markov inequality applied to Lemma 31, whp $G$ is such that for each $1 \\le s \\le n$ there are at most $n^{5/2}(ed)^s$ connected subsets of size $s$. By Lemmas 47 and 35, there is $A > 0$ such that for all $d$ large enough, whp $G$ is such that for all $\\beta \\in (0, \\beta_1]$, any polymer $\\gamma$ with at least $\\frac{A \\log n}{d}$ vertices has weight at most $q^{1-|V_G(\\gamma)|/10}$, and also for any connected vertex set $S \\subseteq V_C$ of size at least $\\frac{A \\log n}{d}$ has $e_G(S) \\le (2d/3+1)|S|$. Further on, assume $G$ is such that the above holds. By the previous lemma and by union bound, it is sufficient to prove that\n$$ \\sum_{\\substack{\\gamma \\in \\cup_{F \\in \\Omega_C^{\\mathrm{dis}}} \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{dis}} \\\\ |V_G(\\gamma)| \\ge A \\log n/d}} w^{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\gamma) \\le q^{-A \\log n/(25d)}. $$\nFor any connected subset $S$ of the size $\\ge \\frac{A \\log n}{d}$, $e_G(S) \\le (2d/3+1)|S|$, hence there are at most $2^{(2d/3+1)|S|}$ possible connected subgraphs of $G$ with the vertex set $S$. Hence the number of polymers with $s \\ge \\frac{A \\log n}{d}$ vertices is at most $n^{5/2}(ed)^s 2^{(2d/3+1)s}$. By Lemma 47, for any polymer with $s \\ge \\frac{A \\log n}{d}$ vertices, its weight is at most $q^{1-s/10}$. Thus summing through all possible sizes gives us that the the sum is at most\n$$ \\sum_{s \\ge (A/d) \\log n} n^{5/2}(ed)^s 2^{(2d/3+1)s} q^{1-s/10} = q n^{5/2} \\sum_{s \\ge (A/d) \\log n} [2^{2d/3+1} ed q^{-1/10}]^s. $$\nFinally, provided that $q$ is sufficiently large, $2^{2d/3+1}edq^{-1/10} < q^{-1/20}$, and for $q$ large enough, the sum can be also bound by $O(n^{5/2}q^{-A \\log n/(20d)}) \\le q^{-A \\log n/(25d)}$.",
