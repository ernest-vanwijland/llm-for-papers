  "proof": "The given conditions imply that the vector $c/\\alpha$ satisfies $|c/\\alpha|_1 \\le k$ and $|c/\\alpha|_\\infty \\le 1$. It is a well-known result that any such vector can be expressed as a convex combination of $\\{0,1\\}$-vectors, each having at most $k$ entries equal to 1. For every $\\{0,1\\}$-vector $d$ in this combination, the inequality $\\sum_{r \\in V} d(r) \\text{cost}_C(r) \\le \\text{cost}_C^k$ holds. By taking the convex combination of these individual inequalities, we obtain $\\sum_{r \\in V} \\frac{c(r)}{\\alpha} \\text{cost}_C(r) \\le \\text{cost}_C^k$. This expression is equivalent to the inequality asserted in the statement.",
