  "proof": "We begin by noting that, according to Lemmas 33 and 34, it holds with high probability that all vertex sets in G with a size of at least $\\eta n$ have an average degree of no less than $3d/4$. Furthermore, the second part of the first lemma implies that, with high probability, any vertex set $S \\subseteq V_G$ with a size between $\\eta n$ and $(1-\\eta)n$ satisfies the inequality $|E_G(S,S)| \\ge \\frac{5d}{6}|S|(n-|S|)$. It also holds with high probability that $n_C \\ge (1-e^{-d/3})n$. For the remainder of the proof, we will assume that G satisfies these properties.\n\nBased on our choice of $\\eta$ and by applying Lemma 12, it is also true with high probability that for any given $F \\in \\Omega_C^{\\text{ord}}$, the graph $(V_C, F)$ has a giant component with a total degree of at least $\\frac{9}{10}\\text{degg}(V_C)$. Consequently, if we let $S$ be the set of vertices belonging to the non-giant components, its total degree can be at most $\\frac{1}{10}\\text{degg}(V_C)$. It is important to observe that every edge in $E_G(S,S)$ must be an element of $E_C \\setminus F$. We will now analyze three distinct cases determined by the size of S.\n\nFirst, suppose that $|S| \\ge \\frac{n}{2}$. In this scenario, the total degree of $S$ must be greater than $\\frac{dn}{4}$. However, we have already established that $\\text{degg}(S) \\le \\frac{\\text{degg}(V_C)}{10}$, which is less than $\\frac{dn}{10}+o(n)$. This leads to a contradiction.\n\nFor the second case, let's assume $\\eta n \\le |S| \\le \\frac{n}{2}$. It follows that $|E_C \\setminus F| \\ge |E_G(S,S)|$, which is at least $\\frac{5\\eta nd}{12}$. However, with high probability, the total number of edges satisfies $|E_C| \\le \\frac{dn}{2}+o(n) < \\frac{3dn}{4}$. This leads to a contradiction with the property that $|E_C \\setminus F| \\le \\eta|E_C|$.\n\nTherefore, the only case that remains to be considered is $|S| \\le \\eta n$. In this situation, the number of connected components $c(F)$ is bounded by $|S|+1$, so $c(F) \\le \\eta n + 1$. Additionally, the number of edges in $F$ is less than the total number of edges in $E_C$, which with high probability is at most $nd/2+\\eta n$. From these bounds, we can derive an upper bound for the weight $w_C(F)$, finding that $w_C(F) < q^{\\eta n+1}(e^\\beta - 1)^{nd/2+\\eta n} < q^{\\eta n+2-1/10 \\cdot nd/d+\\eta n} = q^{n[1-1/20+2\\eta]}$.\n\nSince the empty set $\\emptyset$ is a configuration with weight $q^{n_C} > q^{n(1-e^{-d/3})}$, it follows that the partition function is bounded by $Z_C > q^{n-ne^{-d/3}}$. The total number of ordered configurations is at most $2^{|E_C|} = 2^{nd/2+\\eta n}$. This allows us to bound the ratio of the partition functions as follows:\n$$ \\frac{Z_C^{\\text{dis}}}{Z_C} < 2^{nd/2+\\eta n}q^{n[\\eta-1+1-1/10+2\\eta+e^{-d/3}]} = \\exp\\{n[d\\ln 2/2 + \\log q(-1/10+2\\eta+e^{-d/3})]\\}. $$\nFor a sufficiently large value of $d$, the inequality $1/10 - 2\\eta - e^{-d/3} > 1/20$ is satisfied. Consequently, the expression for the ratio is bounded above by $\\exp\\{nd \\ln 2/2 - n \\log q/20\\}$. For a large enough $q$, this value is in turn bounded by $\\le e^{-n}$.",
