  "proof": "The core of this proof is to demonstrate that for any given configuration $F$ within the set $\\mathcal{B}$, the following inequality holds:\n$$\\c(F) - \\frac{2}{d}|E_C \\setminus F| \\le -\\rho n \\text{ with } \\rho = \\eta/20.\n\\quad(10)\n$$\nLet's first complete the lemma's proof by assuming equation (10) is true for now. We will begin by showing that (10) implies $w_C(F)/Z_C \\le q^{-\\rho n}$ for any $\\beta > 0$. If we consider the case where $e^\\beta - 1 \\le q^{2/d}$, we can use the lower bound $Z_C \\ge q^{n_c} \\ge q^{n(1-e^{-d/3})}$, where the latter inequality is true with high probability. This means for any $F \\in \\mathcal{B}$:\n$$\n\\frac{w_C(F)}{Z_C} = q^{c(F)-n+ne^{-d/3}} (e^\\beta - 1)^{|E_C|-|E_C \\setminus F|} \\le q^{c(F)-\\frac{2}{d}|E_C \\setminus F| - n + \\frac{2}{d}|E_C| + ne^{-d/3}}.\n$$\nWith high probability, we know that $|E_C| \\le |E_G| \\le nd/2 + \\frac{\\eta n}{10}$. This implies that $\\frac{2}{d}|E_C| - n \\le n-n+\\frac{\\eta n}{10}$. Therefore, for a sufficiently large $d$ (noting that $\\eta$ is a constant), we find that $w_C(F)/Z_C \\le q^{-\\rho n/4}$. Similarly, for the case where $e^\\beta - 1 \\ge q^{2/d}$, we employ the lower bound $Z_C \\ge (e^\\beta-1)^{|E_C|}$, leading to the following for any $F \\in \\mathcal{B}$:\n$$\n\\frac{w_C(F)}{Z_C} = q^{c(F)} (e^\\beta - 1)^{-|E_C \\setminus F|} \\le q^{c(F) - \\frac{2}{d}|E_C \\setminus F|} \\le q^{-\\rho n}.\n$$\nTo conclude this part, we note that the size of $\\mathcal{B}$ has a trivial upper bound of $|\\Omega_C| \\le 2^{|E_C|} \\le 2^{nd/2+n\\eta/40}$. This allows us to bound the sum:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{Z_C} \\sum_{F \\in \\mathcal{B}} w_C(F) \\le 2^{nd/2+n\\eta/40} q^{-\\rho n/4}\n$$\nFor a large enough $q$, this value becomes less than or equal to $e^{-n}$.\n\nNow, we return to establish the proof for inequality (10). Let's fix an arbitrary configuration $F \\in \\mathcal{B}$. We can categorize the vertices of C into four distinct sets, $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$, based on the size of the components they belong to in the graph $(V_C, F)$. $S_1$ contains vertices in single-vertex components. $S_2$ contains vertices in components with sizes from 2 to $\\log n$. $S_3$ contains vertices in components larger than $\\log n$ but no larger than $\\frac{n}{\\ell}$. Finally, $S_4$ includes vertices from components larger than $\\frac{n}{\\ell}$. Let's denote the size of these sets as $n_i := |S_i|$. This partition provides a straightforward upper bound for the number of components:\n$$\\c(F) \\le n_1 + \\frac{n_2}{2} + \\frac{n_3}{\\log n} + 6.\n\\quad(11)\n$$\nNext, we will establish a lower bound for $|E_C\\setminus F|$ by counting the number of edges extending outward from the vertices in each set.\n1.  For $S_1$, any edge connected to a vertex in this set must belong to $E_C \\setminus F$. Summing over all vertices in $S_1$, we find at least $\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{deg}_G(S_1)$ such edges, where the factor of $1/2$ corrects for edges between two vertices in $S_1$.\n2.  For $S_2$, according to Lemma 29, there is a constant $k$ for which all sets up to size $\\log n$ are $k$-treelike with high probability. Lemma 30 also states that connected sets up to size $2k$ are 1-treelike. For a component $\\kappa$ of size between 2 and $\\log n$, if its size is less than $2k$, it is 1-treelike, which means $|E_G(V_G(\\kappa), \\overline{V_G(\\kappa)})| \\ge \\mathrm{deg}_G(\\kappa) - 2|V_G(\\kappa)|$. If its size is between $2k$ and $\\log n$, it is $k$-treelike, leading to $|E_G(V_G(\\kappa), \\overline{V_G(\\kappa)})| \\ge \\mathrm{deg}_G(\\kappa) - 3|V_G(\\kappa)|$. Aggregating over all components in $S_2$, we get at least $\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathrm{deg}_G(S_2) - 3n_2)$ edges in $E_C \\setminus F$ connected to $S_2$, with the $1/2$ factor again preventing double-counting.\n3.  For $S_3$, components with sizes between $\\log n$ and $\\frac{n}{\\ell}$ are considered. Proposition 11 ensures that for a large enough $d$, any connected subset $S$ in this size range has at least $\\frac{3}{5}|\\mathrm{deg}_G(S)|$ edges connecting to its complement. Thus, for any component $\\kappa$ in this range, at least this fraction of its degree consists of outgoing edges. Summing up and correcting for double counts, the total number of out-edges from $S_3$ is at least $\\frac{3}{10}\\mathrm{deg}_G(S_3)$.\n4.  For $S_4$, which contains large components, if the size of $S_4$ falls within the range $[\\eta n/4, n(1-\\eta/4)]$, Lemma 33 guarantees that $|E_G(S_4, \\bar{S}_4)| > \\frac{dn}{30}\\eta$. We use this as a lower bound for the number of out-edges, applying a trivial bound of 0 if $|S_4|$ is outside this range.\n\nCombining these points, we get a total lower bound for the missing edges:\n$$\n|E_C \\setminus F| \\ge \\frac{1}{2}[\\mathrm{deg}_G(S_1 \\cup S_2) - 3n_2 + \\frac{3}{5}\\mathrm{deg}_G(S_3) + \\frac{dn}{15}\\eta \\mathbf{1}\\{\\eta n/4 \\le |S_4| \\le (1 - \\eta n/4)\\}]\n$$\nUsing Proposition 41, which bounds the number of low-degree vertices, this becomes:\n$$\n\\ge \\frac{1}{2}[(1-d^{-1/3})d(n_1+n_2+\\frac{3}{5}n_3-2ne^{-d^{1/3}}) + \\frac{dn}{15}\\eta \\mathbf{1}\\{\\eta n/4 \\le |S_4| \\le (1 - \\eta n/4)\\}],\n\\quad(12)\n$$\nSubstituting (11) and (12) into our target expression, we find:\n$$\\c(F) - \\frac{2}{d}|E_C \\setminus F| \\le n_1 + (\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3})n_2 + \\frac{n_3}{\\log n} + 6 - (1-d^{-1/3})[n_1+n_2+\\frac{3}{5}n_3] + 2ne^{-d^{1/3}} - \\frac{\\eta n}{15} \\mathbf{1}\\{\\eta n/4 \\le |S_4| \\le (n - \\eta n/4)\\}.\n$$\nFor sufficiently large $d$ and $n$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\c(F) - \\frac{2}{d}|E_C \\setminus F| \\le d^{-1/3}n_1 - \\frac{n_2+n_3}{4} - \\frac{\\eta n}{6}\\mathbf{1}\\{\\eta n/4 \\le |S_4| \\le (n-\\eta n/4)\\} + 2ne^{-d^{1/3}} + 6.\n\\quad(13)\n$$\nWe now analyze four distinct cases based on the sizes of the partitions.\n* Case 0: $n_1 \\ge 1-\\frac{2\\eta}{3}$. In this situation, we can show that $|F| < \\frac{\\eta}{10}|E_C|$, which contradicts the assumption that $F \\in \\mathcal{B}$, thereby ruling out this case.\n* Case 1: $n_4 > n(1-\\eta/2)$. With few large components, we can bound $c(F) < \\eta n/2+6$. The number of missing edges is large, $|E_C \\setminus F| > \\frac{dn}{27}\\eta$. Combining these demonstrates that $c(F) - \\frac{2}{d}|E_C \\setminus F| < -\\frac{\\eta n}{20}$.\n* Case 2: $n_2+n_3 \\ge \\eta n/3$. Inserting this condition into (13) shows that for a large enough $d$ and $n$, the expression is dominated by the negative term $-\\frac{\\eta n}{12}$, which again yields the desired inequality (10).\n* Case 3: This covers the remaining possibilities where $n_2+n_3 < \\eta n/3$, $n_1 < n(1-2\\eta/3)$, and $n_4 < n(1-\\eta/2)$. These conditions together imply that $n_4$ must be at least $\\eta n/4$. In this scenario, the indicator function in (13) is active, and the term $-\\frac{\\eta n}{6}$ ensures the inequality holds for large $d$ and $n$.\n\nSince all possible cases lead to the desired result, the proof of (10) is finished, which in turn completes the proof of Lemma 53.",
