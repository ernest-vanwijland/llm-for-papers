  "proof": "Let's start by considering any arbitrary configuration $F$ from the set $B_1$. From our analysis in Case 0 of the proof for Lemma 53, we recall that the count of single-vertex components in the graph $(V_C, F)$ does not exceed $(1 - \\frac{2\\eta}{3})n$. We will define $S$ as the set of all vertices belonging to components of size two or more.\nIt is important to observe that all edges within the configuration $F$ must connect vertices that are in $S$, which means the number of edges $|F|$ is bounded by the number of edges within the subgraph induced by $S$, denoted $e_G(S)$. By synthesizing the results from Lemmas 29, 30, and 35, we find that for a sufficiently large $d$, it is highly probable that any connected subset $S' \\subseteq S$ will satisfy the inequality $e_G(S') \\le |S'|(1+\\max(1, d\\eta/3))$. This leads to the conclusion that $e_G(S) \\le |S|(2+d\\eta/3)$. Given that $e_G(S)$ is at least as large as $|F|$, which in turn is at least $\\frac{9\\eta}{10}|E_C|$, it must follow that the size of $S$ is bounded below: $|S| \\ge \\frac{9\\eta|E_C|}{10d(\\eta/3+2/d)}$. Because every component that contributes to the set $S$ contains a minimum of two vertices, the total number of components in the configuration, $c(F)$, can be bounded above by $n - |S| + |S|/2$, which simplifies to $n - |S|/2$. With this, we can now establish an upper bound on the ratio of weights:\n$$ \\frac{w_G(F)}{w_G(\\emptyset)} = q^{n-\\frac{|S|}{2} - n_C}(e^\\beta-1)^{|F|} \\le q^{n - \\frac{9\\eta|E_C|}{20d(\\eta/3+2/d)} - n_C} (e^{\\beta_1}-1)^{\\eta|E_C|} $$\nThe final inequality in this expression is a result of the condition $\\beta \\le \\beta_1$ and the high-probability event that $n_C \\ge n(1-e^{-d/3})$. For any sufficiently large $d$, the expression $\\frac{9}{2(\\eta/3+2/d)}-21$ will be greater than 1. Lemma 39 tells us that, with high probability, $|E_C|$ is at least $\\frac{dn}{3}$. This allows us to conclude that the ratio $\\frac{w_C(F)}{Z_C^{\\text{dis}}}$ is less than $q^{-n[\\eta/20-e^{-d/3}]}$. For a sufficiently large $d$, this upper bound can be simplified to at most $q^{-n\\eta/30}$. Finally, by summing over all possible configurations $F$, of which there are at most $2^{|E_C|} \\le 2^{dn}$, we arrive at the final result: $\\pi_C^{\\text{dis}}(B_1) \\le e^{-n}$ for any sufficiently large $q$.",
