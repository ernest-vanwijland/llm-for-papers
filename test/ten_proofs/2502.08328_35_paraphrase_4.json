  "proof": "Let's begin with an arbitrary configuration, denoted as $F$, from the set $B_0$. Initially, we recall a result from the proof of Lemma 51, which establishes that for any sufficiently large $d$, it is highly probable that the graph $G$ has the property that for any ordered configuration $F$, the number of components, $c(F)$, is at most $1 + \\eta n$. We will define a set $S$ to be the collection of vertices that are part of the non-giant components within the graph $(V_c, F)$.\nOur next step is to establish an upper bound for the ratio $w_c(F)/Z_c^{\\mathrm{ord}}$ by examining different scenarios. In the scenario where $|S|$ is bounded such that $c(F) - 1 \\le |S| \\le \\eta n/2$, we can utilize the lower bound for the partition function, $Z_c^{\\mathrm{ord}} \\ge (e^\\beta - 1)^{|E_c|}$, along with the condition $\\beta \\ge \\beta_0$. This leads to the following:\n$$\n\\frac{w_c(F)}{Z_c^{\\mathrm{ord}}} \\le q^{\\eta n/2}(e^\\beta - 1)^{-|E_c \\setminus F|} \\le q^{\\eta n/2 - \\frac{19}{10d} \\frac{9}{10}\\eta |E_c|}\n$$\nWith high probability, for a sufficiently large $d$, the number of edges $|E_c|$ is at least $\\frac{dn}{3}$. Applying this gives us a more refined bound on the ratio: $\\frac{w_c(F)}{Z_c^{\\mathrm{ord}}} \\le q^{\\eta n(1/2 - 57/100)}$, which simplifies to $q^{-\\eta n/10}$. By aggregating this result over all possible configurations, of which there are fewer than $2^{dn}$, we find that for any sufficiently large value of $q$, the probability $\\pi_c^{\\mathrm{ord}}(B_0)$ is no more than $e^{-n}$.",
