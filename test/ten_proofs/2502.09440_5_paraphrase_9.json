  "proof": "To begin, we will prove our claim by demonstrating a more robust statement: that the collection of graphs represented by $\\{H_i : i \\in [k]\\} \\cup \\{R_{i+1} : i \\in [k]\\}$ is disjoint.\n\nFor any given step $i$ in the range $[k]$, we can refer to Lemmas 3.4 and 3.5. These lemmas establish that $H_{\\text{Base}}(i) \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$, and that $R_{i+1} \\subseteq H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i) \\subseteq H_{\\text{Base}}(i) \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$. From this, we can conclude that both $H_i$ and $R_{i+1}$ are subgraphs contained within $G_{\\text{Base}}(i)$.\n\nFirst, we will show that the graphs $H_i$ and $R_{i+1}$ do not share any edges. By its definition, $H_i$ is selected from the support of $\\mathcal{H}_i$ such that $\\Phi_i(H_i) = M_i$. This means that no edges from $H_i$ can be present in $H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)$. Since we know that $R_{i+1} \\subseteq H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)$, it logically follows that no edge from $R_{i+1}$ can be part of $H_i$.\n\nNext, our goal is to prove that $G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$ also shares no edges with either $H_i$ or $R_{i+1}$. Consider any edge within $H_i$; this edge is part of $H_{\\text{Base}}(i)$ but is not in $H_{\\text{Miss}}(i)$. As a result, it cannot exist in the graph defined by $G_{\\text{Base}}(i) - (H_{\\text{Base}}(i) - H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i))$. Turning to $R_{i+1}$, Lemma 3.5 states that none of its edges connect to any vertex in the set $Q_i$. This means that no edge from $R_{i+1}$ can appear in $G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1) = (G_{\\text{Base}}(i) - (H_{\\text{Base}}(i) - H_{\\text{Miss}}(M_i)))[Q_i]$.\n\nFinally, let's consider any step $j$ that occurs after step $i$ (meaning $j > i$). The sequence of base graphs is nested, such that $G_{\\text{Base}}(j) \\subseteq \\dots \\subseteq G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$. Therefore, any edge $(u,v)$ found in either $H_i$ or $R_{i+1}$ cannot be in $G_{\\text{Base}}(j)$, because we have already established it is not in $G_{\\text{Base}}(i+1)$. Since both $H_j$ and $R_{j+1}$ are constructed as subgraphs from $G_{\\text{Base}}(j)$, the edge $(u,v)$ cannot be in either of them.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that an edge appearing in $H_i$ or $R_{i+1}$ at a given step will not be included in any $H_j$ or $R_{j+1}$ for all subsequent steps $j > i$. Therefore, the entire set $\\{H_i : i \\in [k]\\} \\cup \\{R_{i+1} : i \\in [k]\\}$ is edge-disjoint. Given that $R_1$ is an empty graph, this set accounts for all graphs distributed to any player. This confirms that no two players are ever sent the same edge."
