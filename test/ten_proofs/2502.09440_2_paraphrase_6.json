  "proof": "Proof. Let $P := \\{v \\in V : \\deg(v) \\leq b\\}$. Then, $Q := V \\setminus P$. Since each vertex is in exactly one of $P$ or $Q$, this is a partition.\n\nWe by bounding $G[P]$. For every $v \\in P$, $\\deg(v) \\leq b$ in $G$. Since $G[P]$ is a subgraph of $G$, $\\deg(v) \\leq b$ in $G[P]$ as well. It follows that $\\Delta(G[P]) \\leq b$.\n\nNow for the bound on $|Q|$. It is known that twice the number of edges is equal to the sum of the degrees. Hence, we have\n$$ 2m = \\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v) \\geq  \\sum_{v \\in V \\setminus P} \\deg(v) \\geq \\sum_{v \\in Q} b = |Q| \\cdot b. $$\nThis gives $|Q| \\leq \\frac{2m}{b}$.",
