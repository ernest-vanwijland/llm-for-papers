  "proof": "According to Lemmas 33 and 34, it is highly probable that any vertex set in G of size $\\eta n$ or greater will have an average degree of at least $3d/4$. Furthermore, the second part of the first lemma indicates that, with high probability, for any vertex set $S \\subseteq V_G$ whose size is between $\\eta n$ and $(1-\\eta)n$, the number of edges within that set, $|E_G(S,S)|$, is at least $\\frac{5d}{6}|S|(n-|S|)$. Additionally, it is highly probable that $n_C \\ge (1-e^{-d/3})n$. For the remainder of this proof, we will assume that G possesses these characteristics.\n\nBased on our selection of $\\eta$ and Lemma 12, it is also highly probable that for any ordered configuration $F \\in \\Omega_C^{\\text{ord}}$, a giant component exists within the graph $(V_C, F)$ whose total degree is at least $\\frac{9}{10}\\text{degg}(V_C)$. Consequently, the set of vertices S, which are part of the smaller, non-giant components, will have a combined degree of no more than $\\frac{1}{10}\\text{degg}(V_C)$. It is important to note that every edge in $E_G(S,S)$ must be part of the set of edges $E_C \\setminus F$. We will now analyze three distinct cases, categorized by the size of S.\n\nCase 1: If $|S| \\ge \\frac{n}{2}$, its total degree must be greater than $\\frac{dn}{4}$. However, we also know its total degree is no more than $\\frac{\\text{degg}(V_C)}{10}$, which is less than $\\frac{dn}{10}+o(n)$. This presents a contradiction.\n\nCase 2: Let's examine when the size of S is between $\\eta n$ and $\\frac{n}{2}$. In this scenario, $|E_C \\setminus F|$ must be at least $|E_G(S,S)|$, which is greater than or equal to $\\frac{5\\eta nd}{12}$. But, with high probability, the total number of edges $|E_C|$ is less than $\\frac{3dn}{4}$, which leads to a contradiction with the condition that $|E_C \\setminus F| \\le \\eta|E_C|$.\n\nCase 3: Therefore, the only viable possibility is $|S| \\le \\eta n$. Under this condition, $c(F) \\le |S| \\le \\eta n + 1$ and $|F| < |E_C| \\le nd/2+\\eta n$ (with the last inequality holding with high probability). From this, we can derive that $w_C(F) < q^{\\eta n+1}(e^\\beta - 1)^{nd/2+\\eta n} < q^{\\eta n+2-1/10 \\cdot nd/d+\\eta n} = q^{n[1-1/20+2\\eta]}$.\n\nGiven that the empty set $\\emptyset$ is a configuration with a weight $q^{n_C} > q^{n(1-e^{-d/3})}$, it must be that the partition function $Z_C$ is greater than $q^{n-ne^{-d/3}}$. The number of possible ordered configurations is at most $2^{|E_C|} = 2^{nd/2+\\eta n}$. Consequently, we can establish the following ratio:\n$$ \\frac{Z_C^{\\text{dis}}}{Z_C} < 2^{nd/2+\\eta n}q^{n[\\eta-1+1-1/10+2\\eta+e^{-d/3}]} = \\exp\\{n[d\\ln 2/2 + \\log q(-1/10+2\\eta+e^{-d/3})]\\}. $$\nFor a sufficiently large d, the inequality $1/10 - 2\\eta - e^{-d/3} > 1/20$ holds true. This allows us to simplify the expression to $\\exp\\{nd \\ln 2/2 - n \\log q/20\\}$. For any sufficiently large q, this expression is, in turn, less than or equal to $e^{-n}$.",
