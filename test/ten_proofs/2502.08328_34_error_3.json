  "proof": "Proof. Consider arbitrary $F \\in B_1$. As we saw in Case 0 of the proof of Lemma 53, the number of singleton components in $(V_C, F)$ is at most $(1 - \\frac{2\\eta}{3})n$. Let $S$ be the set of vertices that are in components of size $\\ge 2$.\nNote that the edges of $F$ have all endpoints in $S$, thus $|F| \\le e_G(S)$. Combining Lemmas 29, 30 (with $R$ being the $k$ from the previous lemma) and 35, we get for all $d$ large enough, whp, for any connected subset $S' \\subseteq S$ of $(V_C, F)$, $e_G(S') \\le |S'|(1+\\max(1, d\\eta/3))$. Hence, $e_G(S) \\le |S|(2+d\\eta/3)$. Since $e_G(S) \\ge |F| \\ge \\frac{9\\eta}{10}|E_C|$, we must have $|S| \\ge \\frac{9\\eta|E_C|}{10d(\\eta/3+2/d)}$. Since each component containing $|S|$ has at least 2 vertices, $c(F) \\le n - |S| + |S|/2 = n - |S|/2$. Therefore we can bound\n$$ \\frac{w_G(F)}{w_G(\\emptyset)} = q^{n-\\frac{|S|}{2} - n_C}(e^\\beta-1)^{|F|} \\ge q^{2n - \\frac{8\\eta|E_C|}{10d(\\eta/3+2/d)} - n_C} (e^{\\beta_1}-1)^{\\eta|E_C|} $$\nwhere the last inequality follows from $\\beta \\ge \\beta_1$ and that whp $n_C \\le n(1-e^{-d/3})$. For all $q$ large enough $\\frac{9}{2(\\eta/3+2/d)}-21 > 1$. By Lemma 39, whp $|E_C| \\ge \\frac{dn}{2} - 2ne^{-d/3} \\ge \\frac{dn}{3}$, giving that $\\frac{w_C(F)}{Z_C^{\\text{dis}}} < q^{-n[\\eta/20-e^{-d/3}]}$. For all $d$ large enough, this is at most $q^{-n\\eta/30}$. Aggregating over at most $2^{|E_C|} \\le 2^{dn}$ configurations $F$, we get that $\\pi_C^{\\text{dis}}(B_1) \\le e^{-n}$ for all $q$ large enough.",
