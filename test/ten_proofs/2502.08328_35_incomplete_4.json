  "proof": "Proof. Consider arbitrary $F \\in B_0$. First of all, as we showed in the proof of Lemma 51, for all d large enough, whp G is such that for any ordered F, $c(F) \\le 1 + \\eta n$. Let S be the set of vertices in non-giant components of $(V_c, F)$.\nWe now bound $w_c(F)/Z_c^{\\mathrm{ord}}$ by considering two cases. If $c(F) - 1 \\le |S| \\le \\eta n/2$, then using $Z_c^{\\mathrm{ord}} \\ge (e^\\beta - 1)^{|E_c|}$ and $\\beta \\ge \\beta_0$ we get\n$$\n\\frac{w_c(F)}{Z_c^{\\mathrm{ord}}} \\le q^{\\eta n/2}(e^\\beta - 1)^{-|E_c \\setminus F|} \\le q^{\\eta n/2 - \\frac{19}{10d} \\frac{9}{10}\\eta |E_c|}\n$$\nTaking the aggregate sum over at most $2^{|E_c|} < 2^{dn}$ such configurations, we get that for all q sufficiently large, $\\pi_c^{\\mathrm{ord}}(B_0) \\le e^{-n}$.",
