  "proof": "We begin by considering a configuration $F$ from the set $\\Omega_C^{\\mathrm{dis}}$. For such a configuration, the number of edges $|F|$ is bounded by $\\eta|E_C|$, which in turn implies an upper bound on its weight: $w_C(F) \\le q^{n_C} (e^\\beta - 1)^{\\eta|E_C|}$. The total number of ordered configurations, $|\\Omega_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}|$, cannot exceed $2^{|E_C|}$. Since the case where $F = E_C$ is a valid configuration, we can establish a lower bound for the partition function, $Z_C \\ge q(e^\\beta-1)^{|E_C|}$. With high probability, the number of edges $|E_C|$ is at most $\\frac{dn}{2} + \\eta n$, which gives a more specific upper bound for the number of configurations: $|\\Omega_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}| \\le 2^{n(d/2+\\eta)}$. By synthesizing these inequalities and applying the condition that $\\beta \\ge \\beta_1$, we can establish the following ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{Z_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}}{Z_C} \\le \\frac{2^{(d/2+\\eta)n}q^{n_C}(e^\\beta - 1)^{-(1-\\eta)|E_C|}}{q} \\le q^{n-(1-\\eta)(2+1/10)|E_C|}.\n$$\nFrom Lemma 39, we know that with high probability, $|E_C|$ is at least $\\frac{dn}{2} - 2ne^{-d/3}$. Substituting this lower bound into our previous inequality yields:\n$$\n\\frac{Z_C^{\\mathrm{ord}}}{Z_C} \\le q^{n[1-(1-\\eta)(2+1/10)(d/2-2e^{-d/3})/d]} \\le q^{-n[1/20-2\\eta+5e^{-d/3}/d]}\n$$\nGiven our specific choice of $\\eta$, for any sufficiently large value of $d$, this expression is bounded above by $q^{-n/40}$. Subsequently, for any sufficiently large value of $q$, the expression is further bounded by $e^{-n}$.",
