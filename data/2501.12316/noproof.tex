\begin{abstract}
In \telebr, the goal is to disseminate a message from a given source vertex of an input graph to all other vertices in the minimum number of rounds, where at each round, an informed vertex can send the message to at most one of its uninformed neighbors. For general graphs of $n$ vertices, the problem is NP-complete, and the best existing algorithm has an approximation factor of $\oh(\log n/ \log \log n)$. The existence of a constant factor approximation for the general graphs is still unknown. 

In this paper, we study the problem in two simple families of sparse graphs, namely, cacti and graphs of bounded pathwidth. There have been several efforts to understand the complexity of the problem in cactus graphs, mostly establishing the presence of polynomial-time solutions for restricted families of cactus graphs (e.g.,~\cite{vcevnik2017broadcasting, ehresmann2021approximation, harutyunyan2009necklace, Harutyunyan2007unicyclic, harutyunyan2008unicyclic, harutyunyan2023chainring}). Despite these efforts, the complexity of the problem in arbitrary cactus graphs remained open. We settle this question by establishing the NP-completeness of telephone broadcasting in cactus graphs. For that, we show the problem is NP-complete in a simple subfamily of cactus graphs, which we call \flower graphs. These graphs not only are cacti but also have pathwidth $2$. These results establish that, despite being polynomial-time solvable in trees, the problem becomes NP-complete in very simple extensions of trees.

On the positive side, we present constant-factor approximation algorithms for the studied families of graphs, namely, an algorithm with an approximation factor of $2$ for cactus graphs and an approximation factor of $\oh(1)$ for graphs of bounded pathwidth.
\end{abstract} \section{Introduction}
The \telebr problem involves disseminating a message from a single given source vertex to all other vertices in a network through a series of \emph{telephone calls}.
The network is often modeled as an undirected and unweighted graph of $n$ vertices. Communication takes place in synchronous rounds. Initially, only the source is informed.
 During each round, any informed vertex can transmit the message to at most one of its uninformed neighbors via a ``call''. The goal is to minimize the number of rounds required to inform the entire network. \citet{hedetniemi1988broadsurvey} identifies \telebr as a fundamental primitive in distributed computing and communication theory, forming the basis for many advanced tasks in these fields. 
 
\citet{slater1981nptree} established the NP-completeness of \telebr. 
Nonetheless, efficient algorithms have been developed for specific classes of graphs. 
In particular, \citet{fraigniaud2002polynomial} demonstrated that the problem is solvable in polynomial time for trees. There are polynomial
algorithms for several other graph families; see, e.g., \cite{damaschke2024starclique, gholami2023fullytree, Liestman1988Boundeddegree, stohr1991butterfly}.


In this paper, we study cactus graphs, which are graphs in which

any two cycles share at most one vertex. 
Cacti are a natural generalization of trees and ring graphs, providing a flexible model for applications such as wireless sensor networks, particularly when tree structures are too restrictive~\cite{ben2012centdian}.
 
There have been several studies for broadcasting in specific families of cactus graphs \cite{vcevnik2017broadcasting, ehresmann2021approximation, harutyunyan2009necklace, Harutyunyan2007unicyclic, harutyunyan2008unicyclic, harutyunyan2023chainring}. For instance, for unicyclic graphs, a simple subset of cactus graphs containing exactly one cycle, the problem is solvable in linear time~\cite{Harutyunyan2007unicyclic}.
Similarly, \cite{harutyunyan2023chainring} proved that the chain of rings, which consists of cycles connected sequentially by a single vertex, has an optimal algorithm that runs in linear time. 
In $k$-restricted cactus graphs, where each vertex belongs to at most $k$ cycles, for a fixed constant $k$, \citet{vcevnik2017broadcasting} proposed algorithms that compute the optimal broadcast scheme 
in $\oh(n)$ time. Despite all these efforts, the complexity of \telebr for arbitrary cactus graphs has remained open, a question that we resolve in this paper. 

\telebr is NP-hard for general graphs~\cite{GareyJ79}, and even for restricted graphs. In particular, Tale recently showed that the problem remains NP-hard for graphs of pathwidth of $3$ \cite{tale2024double}, a result that naturally extends to graphs with higher pathwidths. However, the complexity of the problem for graphs of pathwidth $2$ has remained an open question, which we address in this paper.

\citet{elkin2002lowerbound} proved that approximating \telebr within a factor of $3 - \epsilon$ for any $\epsilon > 0$ is NP-hard. \citet{kortsarz1995approximation} showed that \telebr in general graphs has an approximation ratio of $\oh(\log n / \log \log n)$. 
It is possible that there is a constant factor approximation for general graphs. However, 
constant-factor approximation exists only for restricted graph classes such as unit disk graphs~\cite{shang2010unitdisk} and certain sub-families of cactus graphs such as $k$-cycle graphs~\cite{BhabakH15}.

\subsection{Contribution}
This paper investigates the complexity and approximation algorithms for the \telebr problem for cacti and graphs of bounded pathwidth. The key contributions are summarized as follows: \vspace{1mm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We present a simple polynomial-time algorithm, named \ouralgo, and prove it has an approximation factor of 2 for broadcasting in cactus graphs (Theorem~\ref{thm:2approx}). Constant-factor approximations are known for certain subfamilies of cactus graphs (e.g., $k$-cycle graphs~\cite{BhabakH15}), and our result extends this to arbitrary cactus graphs.   
\ouralgo is  
reminiscent of the tree algorithm of~\cite{fraigniaud2002polynomial} and leverages the separatability of cactus graphs. 
In our analysis of \ouralgo, we use the \fast model of broadcasting~\cite{grigni1991tightkbroad} as a reference point, where each vertex can inform up to two neighbors in a single round. 

\item Our main contribution is to establish the NP-completeness of \telebr problem in ``\flower graphs'', which are a subclass of cactus graphs and also have pathwidth at most $2$, therefore resolving the complexity of the problem in these graph families (Theorem~\ref{thm:hardness-flower}). For a formal definition of \flower graphs, refer to Definition~\ref{def:ourflowergraph}. This hardness result is achieved through a series of reductions that start from \sssattt, a variant of the satisfiability problem that is NP-complete
\cite{tovey1984simplified}. 
    \item We show the existence of a constant-factor approximation for graphs of bounded pathwidth.  
    For that, we 
    show the algorithm of \citet{elkin2006sublogarithmic} has an approximation factor of 
$\oh(4^\pwidth)$ for any graph of constant pathwidth $\pwidth$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:approximation-constant}). Note that this result does not rely on having a path decomposition certifying a bounded pathwidth. 
Constant-factor approximation algorithms are known for certain families of graphs of bounded path-width such as 
$k$-path graphs, which admit a $2$-approximation algorithm~\cite{harutyunyan2023kpath}, and our result extends this to any graph of bounded pathwidth. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Paper Structure}
In Section~\ref{sec:preliminaries}, we present the preliminaries.
In Section~\ref{sec:2approx}, we propose \ouralgo, which gives a $2$-approximation 
for cactus graphs. In Section~\ref{sec:hardness}, we 
establish the NP-completeness of the problem in \flower graphs.
In Section~\ref{sec:pathwidth-approx}, 
we present a constant-factor approximation algorithm for graphs of bounded pathwidth. 
We conclude in Section~\ref{section:concluding}. 

 \section{Preliminaries} \label{sec:preliminaries}
For a positive integer $n$, we use notation $[n]$ to denote 
$\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$. Also, we use $[i,j]$ to refer to denote $\{i,i+1,\ldots, j\}$. 
For a graph $G$, we use $G\setminus \{v\}$ to refer to the subgraph of $G$ induced by all vertices of $G$ except $v$.
 \begin{definition}[\cite{hedetniemi1988broadsurvey}]
    An instance $(G,s)$ of the 
     \emph{\telebr} problem  
     is defined by a connected, undirected, and unweighted graph $G=(V, E)$ and a vertex $s \in V$, where $s$ is the only informed vertex. 
     The broadcasting protocol is synchronous and occurs in discrete rounds. In each round, an informed vertex can inform at most one of its uninformed neighbors. The goal is to broadcast the message as quickly as possible so that all vertices in $V$ get informed in the minimum number of rounds.
 \end{definition}

A broadcast scheme describes the ordering at which each vertex informs its neighbors. One can describe a broadcast scheme $S$ with a \emph{broadcast tree}, which is a spanning tree of $G$ rooted at source $s$; if a vertex $u$ is informed through vertex $v$, then $u$ will be a child of $v$ in the broadcast tree. Given that the optimal broadcast scheme of trees can be computed in linear time, a broadcast tree can fully describe the broadcast scheme. We use $\bropt(G,s)$ to refer to the number of rounds in the optimal broadcast scheme. 

\begin{definition}
    \emph{Cactus graphs} are 
    connected graphs in which any two simple cycles 
    have at most one vertex in common.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{def:ourflowergraph}
A tree $T$ is said to be a \emph{\cater} if there are three special nodes $x, y,$ and $z$ in $T$ such that every node in $T$ is either located on the path between $x$ and $y$ or is connected to $z$. 

A graph $G$ is said to be a \flower, if and only if it has a \pistil vertex $c$ such that $G\setminus \{c\}$ is a set of disjoint reduced caterpillars 
such that $c$ is
connected to exactly two vertices in any of these caterpillars, none being special vertices.
\end{definition}

An example of \flower graphs and one of its corresponding reduced caterpillar components is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flowergraphs_example}. Informally, a \flower graph is formed by a set of cycles that have a common \pistil $c$; moreover, each cycle has a special vertex ($z$ vertices). Any vertex in $G$ is either 
i) a part of one of the cycles or 
ii) a part of a ``dangling path'' connected to a neighbor of $c$ or 
iii) finds a special vertex as its sole neighbor.

\begin{definition}[\cite{robertson1983pathwidth}]
A path decomposition $D$ of a given graph $G = (V,E)$ 
    is a sequence $\langle B_1, B_2, \dots, B_k\rangle$, where each $B_i$ is called a bag and contains a subset of $V$, such that every vertex $v \in V$ appears in at least one bag and, for every edge $(u, v) \in E$, there exists a bag $B_i$ containing both $u$ and $v$. Furthermore, 
    if a vertex $v$ appears in $B_i$ and in $B_j$, it must appear in any $B_k$ where $k\in[i,j]$.

    The width of the path decomposition $D$ is the maximum cardinality of its bags minus $1$. Now, $G$ is said to have pathwidth $w$ if it has a path decomposition of width at most $w$.

 \section{\ouralgo: A 2-Approximation for Cactus Graphs}
\label{sec:2approx}

In this section, we present our 2-approximation algorithm for cactus graphs. We use ideas from \fast model with parameter $k$~\cite{grigni1991tightkbroad}, where a vertex can inform up to $k$ of its neighbors in a single round via a 
\emph{super call}. It is easy to see that if one can complete $k$-broadcasting in $m$ rounds, then it is possible to complete broadcasting (in the classic setting) within $km$ rounds. This can be achieved by ``simulating'' a super-call with up to $k$ regular calls (see  Lemma~\ref{lemma:2approx2calls}).
For our algorithm, we use \fast with $k=2$. In particular, we design an algorithm for \twofast in a cactus graph $G$ and show that if it completes within $m$ rounds, then any broadcast scheme for classic broadcasting in $G$ takes at least $m$ rounds (see Lemma~\ref{lemma:2approxOPT}). Therefore, if we simulate every super call with two regular calls (in arbitrary order) using Lemma~\ref{lemma:2approx2calls}, the broadcasting completes within $2m$ rounds, and thus, we achieve an approximation factor of $2$. 


\subsection{\Fast Model}

In the \fast model, an informed vertex can simultaneously inform up to $k$ neighbors in a single round, a process we refer to as a \textbf{super call}.  
Creating networks that allow fast broadcasting under this model has been studied in previous work~\cite{harutyunyan2001improved}. 
We will present a method to convert a broadcasting schema in the \fast model into the classic model (without super calls). The final number of rounds in the classic model will be at most $k$ times the number of rounds in the \fast model. This model applies not only to cactus graphs but also to every arbitrary graph. 




\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:2approx2calls}
Let $S_k$ be a 
broadcast schema for graph $G$ in the \fast model. It is possible to convert $S_k$ to a broadcast scheme $S$ in linear time for graph $G$ in the classic model such that broadcasting in $S$ completes within $k$ times the number of rounds as broadcasting in $S_k$, i.e., $\br(S) \leq k\cdot \br(S_k)$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 3}\end{proof}


\subsection{\ouralgo Algorithm}
This section presents \ouralgo, a \twofast algorithm 
that yields our $2$-approximation algorithm for the \telebr problem in cactus graphs. 
\ouralgo is a mutually recursive algorithm with two main methods, namely, 
    \singlefunc{$G, s$} and
    \doublefunc{$G, s_1, s_2$}.
The \singlefunc{$G, s$} method is used for \twofast a connected subgraph $G$ starting from a source vertex $s$. The \doublefunc{$G, s_1, s_2$} method is used for \twofast a connected subgraph $G$ using two sources $s_1$ and $s_2$ under an assumption that both $s_1$ and $s_2$ have the message at time $0$ and there is a unique path between them in $G$.  


\subparagraph*{Broadcasting from a single source.}
We explain how \singlefunc{$G, s$} operates. Observe that removing the source vertex $s$ partitions $G$ into one or more disjoint connected components. By the definition of cactus graphs, each of these connected components contains at most two neighbors of $s$ 
(see Observation~\ref{observation:two-neighbors}). We refer to a connected component with one neighbor (respectively two neighbors) of $s$ as a \emph{single-neighbor} (respectively \emph{double-neighbor}) component (see Figure~\ref{fig:2approxSingleSource}).

\figcomponent

\begin{observation}
\label{observation:two-neighbors}
Let $H$ be a connected induced subgraph of a cactus graph $G$. Any vertex $v \in G$ that is not in $H$ finds at most 2 neighbors in $H$.
\end{observation}
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 4}\end{proof}

\singlefunc{$G,s$} computes the broadcast time of each single-neighbor component $C$ 
recursively by computing \singlefunc{$C, u$}, where $u$ is the single neighbor of $s$ in $C$. Similarly, it computes the broadcast time of each double-neighbor component $C$ by computing 
\doublefunc{$C, u, v$}, where $u, v$ are neighbors of $s$ in $C$. 
After calculating all these broadcasting times, \singlefunc{$G,s$} sorts these values in non-increasing order and informs the neighbors of $s$ in this order. For that, it uses a regular call for single-neighbor components and a super-call for double-neighbor components. 
In other words, \singlefunc{$G,s$},  informs 
the component with the largest broadcasting time in the first round, the component with the second largest broadcast time next, and so on. This is reminiscent of broadcasting in trees~\cite{fraigniaud2002polynomial}, except that super-calls are used for double components. Let $b_i$ denote the broadcast time of the $i$'th component $C_i$ in this order. 

The total broadcasting time for $\singlefunc{G,s}$ is then computed as $\max_i (i+b_i)$, which will be the output of $\singlefunc{G,s}$. 


\subparagraph*{Broadcasting from two sources.} Next, we describe \doublefunc{$G, s_1, s_2$}. 
Let $P$ be the unique path between $s_1$ and $s_2$.
In any broadcast tree $T$ of
\doublefuncc, some vertices on $P$ are informed through $s_1$ and some through $s_2$. Thus, 
exactly one edge $e \in P$ is excluded from the tree. 
After removing such $e$, the graph $G$ will be partitioned into two disjoint connected components $G_1^{e}$ and $G_2^{e}$, which are respectively informed through $s_1$ and $s_2$ (See Figure~\ref{fig:2approxDoubleMerge}). 
The method \doublefuncc works by removing the edge $e^*$
with a minimum value of 
\linebreak $\max \{ \singlefuncc (G_1^{e},s_1), \singlefuncc (G_2^{e},s_2) \}$ 
over all $e\in P$. 

Next, we explain how \doublefuncc finds $e^*$. An exhaustive approach that 
tries all edges $e\in P$ and calls \singlefuncc twice per edge may take exponential time. 

To fix this, 
\doublefuncc works in two phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In {Phase} ${1}$, the method pre-computes the broadcast time for the connected subgraphs of $G$ after removing vertices of $P$ from $G$. By Observation~\ref{observation:two-neighbors}, 
every resulting connected component after removing $P$ has at most two neighbors in $P$. For any single-neighbor component $C$ with vertex $s$ connected to $P$, \singlefunc{$C,s$} is computed recursively. Similarly, for any double-neighbor component with vertices $s_1, s_2$ connected to $P$,  \doublefunc{$C,s_1,s_2$} is computed recursively. 


\item Next, we describe {Phase} ${2}$. At each iteration of Phase $2$, we fix an edge $e=(u,v) \in P$ and aim to compute \singlefunc{$G_1^e,s_1$} and \singlefunc{$G_2^e,s_2$}, where $u\in G_1^e$ and $v\in G_2^e$. 
We explain how to efficiently compute \singlefunc{$G_1^e,s_1$}. Finding \singlefunc{$G_2^e,s_2$} is done similarly. 
Let $\langle u(=u_1), u_2, \ldots, u_k(=s_1)\rangle$ be the sequence of vertices in the unique path from $u$ to $s_1$.
Let $H^e_{i}$ be the connected component of $G$ that contains $u_i$ after removing the edge ($u_i, u_{i+1}$) from $G_1^e$. 
Note that $H^e_k = G_1^e$. 
We compute $b_i=$\singlefunc{$H^e_i, u_i$} using the values computed in Phase $1$ as follows in an iterative manner from $i=1$ to $i=k$. 

Consider all connected components of $H^e_i$ after removing $u_i$. Note that, for $i>1$, $H^e_{i-1}$ is one of these components. 
Consider the set $B$ of broadcast times for all these components, 
with the neighbor(s) of $u_i$ as the source(s) of broadcast. All these values are computed in Phase $1$ except for $b_{i-1}$, which is computed in the previous iteration. \doublefuncc sorts $B$ in non-increasing order of broadcast times and informs neighbors of $u_i$ accordingly (similar to \singlefuncc). As a result, in the $i$'th iteration, the broadcast time $b_i$ is computed as $\max_{j \in [B]} (j+B[j]) $. At iteration $i=k$, 
we compute $b_k$, which is indeed \singlefunc{$G^e_1, s_1$} (see Observation~\ref{obs:doublefunc}).
\end{itemize}

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{twoapprox} \label{thm:2approx}
    \ouralgo runs a polynomial-time for \telebr and achieves an approximation factor of $2$ on cactus graphs.
\end{restatable}

\paragraph{Proof Overview.}
We provide an overview of the proof before a formal argument.
First, we show that \ouralgo runs in $\oh(n^3 \log n)$. This can be established using induction on the size of the input graph, based on the recursive nature of the algorithm. Details can be found in Lemma~\ref{lemma:2approxpoly}.

Second, we show that \ouralgo has an approximation factor of $2$. Intuitively, \singlefuncc with super-calls runs no longer than an optimal broadcast scheme without super-calls; this is because every super call only expedites informing one of the two sources of broadcasting in double-neighbor components. As mentioned earlier (Lemma~\ref{lemma:2approx2calls}), a broadcast scheme with super calls can be simulated with a scheme (without super-calls) that completes no later than twice the number of rounds. 
On the other hand, the selection of edge $e^*$ by \doublefuncc ensures that 
$
    \max (\singlefunc{$G^{e^*}_1, s_1$}, \singlefunc{$G^{e^*}_2, s_2$}) \leq \max (\singlefunc{$G^{e^+}_1, s_1$}, \singlefunc{$G^{e^+}_2, s_2$})
$, 
where $e^+$ is the edge that is absent in the optimal broadcast tree of $G$. 
A formal proof follows from an inductive argument on the input size (see Lemma~\ref{lemma:2approxOPT}).

\begin{observation}\label{obs:doublefunc}
Let $\langle u_1 (=u), u_2,\ldots, u_k (=s_1) \rangle$ be the vertices on the path from $u_1$ (an endpoint of the removed edge $e$) and the source $s_1$. Then, for any $i\in [k]$, the broadcast time $b_i$ for $(H^e_i,u_i)$ in \doublefuncc equals to \singlefuncc applied to $H_i$, that is, $b_i = $ \singlefunc{$H^e_i, u_i$}.
\end{observation}
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 5}\end{proof}


\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:2approxpoly}
\ouralgo terminates in $\oh(n^3 \log n)$ time.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 6}\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:2approxOPT}
Consider an instance  $(G,s)$ of the broadcasting problem in a cactus graph $G$. Let $\br(G, s)$ denote the number of rounds that it takes for \ouralgo to complete \fast in $G$ with $k=2$, and $\bropt(G, s)$ denote the optimal number of rounds for broadcasting in the classic model. Then we have $\br(G, s)\leq \bropt(G, s)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 7}\end{proof}

From the above results, we can establish the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:2approx} as follows.

\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 8}\end{proof}

The approximation factor given by Theorem~\ref{thm:2approx} is tight. Consider a graph $G$ formed by $t$ triangles that all share an endpoint $s$. The broadcasting time of \ouralgo on $(G,s)$ is $2t$ as its broadcast tree will be a star with $2t$ leaves, while the optimal broadcast tree completes broadcasting in $t+1$ rounds ($s$ will have degree $t$). 
Thus, the approximation factor tends to $2$ for large $t$. 



 \section{Hardness Proof of \Flower Graphs}
\label{sec:hardness}

The NP-hardness proof of \telebr in \flower graphs proceeds through successive reductions. First, we reduce \sssattt, which is known to be NP-hard~\cite{tovey1984simplified} to a new problem that we call \tislong (Lemma~\ref{thm:1}), which itself reduces to another new problem \dsprlong (Lemma~\ref{thm:TIS2DOME}). Finally, we present a reduction from \dspr to \telebg, which establishes our main result (Theorem~\ref{thm:hardness-flower}).
 \subsection{Hardness of \tislong}\label{sec:tishard}
The first step in reducing \sssattt to \telebg is to establish a reduction from \sssattt to \tislong (\tis). For that, we first explain how 
to construct a \tis instance from a given \sssattt instance and demonstrate the equivalence of solutions between the two problems. 

\begin{definition}[\cite{tovey1984simplified}]

The \emph{\sssattt} problem is a special type of the classic $3$-satsifiabiity (\sattt) problem. The input is a boolean CNF formula $\phi=(X, C)$, where $X$ is the set of variables and $C$ is the set of clauses 
such that every clause $C_i \in C$ contains \emph{exactly} three literals $\ell^i_k\in C_i$ for $k\in [3]$, and each variable $x\in X$ appears in at most four clauses. The decision problem asks whether there is a satisfying assignment of $\phi$.
\end{definition}

The \sssattt problem is known to be NP-complete \cite{tovey1984simplified}. 
In what follows, we call a pair of intervals ($I_i$, $\overline{I_i}$) for $i\in [n]$ a \emph{twin interval}, assuming that $I_i$ and $\overline{I_i}$ are non-crossing and have equal lengths with endpoints in $[m]$ for some positive $m$. The endpoints of $I_i$ are less than the endpoints of $\overline{I_i}$. We refer to $I_i$ and $\overline{I}_i$ the \emph{left} and the \emph{right} interval of the twin, respectively.

\begin{definition}

An instance of the \emph{\tislong (\tis)} is formed by a tuple $(I,r,m)$, where $I$ is a set of \emph{twin} interval pairs and $r$ is a \emph{restriction function} with domain $[m]$, where $m$ is referred to the \emph{horizon} of the instance. We have $I = \{(I_1, \overline{I_1}), \ldots, (I_n, \overline{I_n})\}$, where  for each $i\in [m]$, $(I_i, \Bar{I_i})$ are non-crossing intervals with endpoints in $[m]$.

The objective is to select exactly one of $I_i$ and $\overline{I_i}$, while respecting the restriction imposed by the restriction function as follows. The restriction function $r : [m] \to [n]$ requires that for any $t \in [m]$, the number of selected intervals that contain $t$ be at most $r(t)$. The decision problem asks whether there is a valid selection that satisfies these restrictions. 
\end{definition}
For a solution $S$ and $t\in[m]$, let $\Gamma_S(t)$ be the number of selected intervals in $S$ containing $t$.







\subparagraph*{Construction.} 
Suppose we are given an instance $\phi=(X, C)$ of \sssattt. We construct an instance $\mathcal{I}_\phi$ of \tis as follows. 
For each variable $x_i \in X$, 
form a pair of $(X_i,\overline{X_i})$ of twin intervals, each of length $7$, where $X_i = [16i - 15, 16i - 8]$ and 
$\overline{X}_i = [16i - 7, 16i]$. 
We refer to $X_i$ (respectively $\overline{X_i}$) as the \emph{principal} interval of literal $x_i$ (respectively $\neg x_i$). 
The length $7$ of these intervals allows for placing up to $4$ non-crossing unit intervals, each of length $1$, within the principal interval; these intervals will be used for clause gadgets, as we will explain.
For each clause $C_j$, we define three interval twin pairs $(I_k^j,\overline{I_k^j})$, each associated with one of the literals of $\ell^j_k\in C_j$ for each $k\in[3]$. Suppose $\ell^j_k$ is the $p$'th literal where its corresponding variable $x_i\in X$ appears ($p\in[4]$). If $\ell^j_k$ is a positive (respectively negative) literal of variable $x_i$, 
 then define $I_k^j$ as a unit interval starting at $16i-7+2(p-1)$ 
 (respectively, starting at $16i-15+2(p-1)$).
Intuitively, $I_k^j$ is defined as one of the four-unit intervals within the principal interval of $\neg x$.
Meanwhile, $\overline{I_k^j}$ is $[16n+2j, 16n+2j+1]$ for all $k \in [3]$. 
Finally, to define the restriction function, we let $r(t)=1$ for all $t\leq 16n$ and $r(t)=2$, otherwise. Figure~\ref{fig:SAT2TIS-example} illustrates an example of the above reduction. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/sat2tisexample.pdf}
	\caption{Construction of the instance $\mathcal{I}_\phi$ of the \tis problem 
    from the \sssattt instance $\phi = (x_1 \lor \neg{x_2} \lor x_3) \land (\neg{x_1} \lor \neg{x_2} \lor \neg{x_3}) \land (\neg{x_1} \lor \neg{x_2} \lor x_3) $. The restriction function $r(t)$ is defined as $r(t) = 1$ for $t \leq 48$ and $r(t) = 2$ otherwise. A satisfying assignment for $\phi$ is $\sigma(x_1)=1$ and $\sigma(x_2) = \sigma(x_3)=0$; the selected intervals in the corresponding solution for $\mathcal{I}$ are shown in solid color.}
    \label{fig:SAT2TIS-example}
\end{figure}

\subparagraph*{Correctness.}
First, we provide an intuitive explanation of why this reduction works. We argue that a satisfying assignment to instance $\phi$ of the 3,4-SAT problem bijects to a satisfying interval selection for the instance $\mathcal{I}_\phi$ of \tis. The bijection requires that for any literal $\ell$ that is true in a satisfying assignment of $\phi$, the principal interval of $\ell$ is selected in the solution for $\mathcal{I}_\phi$. 

The restrictions imposed by $r$ imply that whenever a principal interval of a literal $\ell$ is selected, the unit intervals associated with (up to $4$) occurrences of $\neg \ell$ 
cannot be selected (because $r(t) = 1$ in their intersecting points). Thus, whenever the principal interval of a literal $\ell$ is selected (i.e., its twin, which is the principal interval of $\neg \ell$ is not selected), one can select the unit intervals associated with any occurrence of $\ell$ in clauses where it appears; this is because they intersect with the principal interval of $\neg \ell$, which is not selected. Selecting these unit intervals means their twin unit intervals
This yields an equivalent between a satisfying assignment in the \sat formula and the \tis. 
We further note that the number of twin intervals in $\mathcal{I}_\phi$ is polynomial in $|X|$ and $|C|$. We can conclude the following lemma, which establishes the hardness of \tis in the strong sense based on the above reduction.

To establish the main result of this section,
we first establish the two sides of the reduction in the following lemmas. 

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma2_SATtoTIS}
If the answer to the instance $\mathcal{I}_\phi$ of \tis is yes, then the instance $\phi$ of \sssattt is satisfiable.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 9}\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma1_SATtoTIS}
If an instance $\phi=(X,C)$ of the \sssattt problem is satisfiable, then the answer to the instance $\mathcal{I}_\phi$ of \tis is yes.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 10}\end{proof}



\begin{restatable}{lemma}{tishard}\label{thm:1}
Answering instances $(I,r,m)$ of the \tis problem is NP-hard even if the $m$ is polynomial in $|I|$. 
\end{restatable}

\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 11}\end{proof}



  \subsection{Hardness of \dsprlong}\label{subsec:hardness:dspr}
We present a polynomial-time reduction from \tis to a new problem that we refer to as \dsprlong (\dspr).
Before defining the \dspr problem, we first define the notion of a \emph{dome} as follows.

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{dome} is formed by four positive integers $(a,b,c,d)$ such that $a \leq b < c \leq d$ and $b-a=d-c$. We refer to $(a,d)$ (respectively $(b,c)$) as an \emph{arc} with endpoints $a$ and $d$ (respectively $b$ and $c$). We refer to $(a,d)$ and $(b,c)$ the \emph{outer arc} and \emph{inner arc} of the dome, respectively. When $a=b$ and $c=d$, we call the dome a \emph{singleton dome} and otherwise call it a \emph{regular dome}.
\end{definition}

 In our figures, a singleton dome $(a,b)$ is shown as \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/singleDome_cdsToB.pdf} and regular dome $(a,b,c,d)$ is shown as \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/RegularDome_CDStoBroadCast.pdf}. 


\begin{definition}
    An instance $(D,m)$ of the \emph{\dsprlong} (\dspr) is defined by a multiset $D= \{D_1,\ldots, D_n\}$ of domes and a positive integer $m$, where $D_i = (a_i,b_i,c_i,d_i)$ s.t. $d_i \leq m$ for some integer $m$ that we refer to as \emph{horizon}. The decision problem asks whether there is a multiset $S$ of arcs with exactly one arc from each dome $D_i$, such that, for any $t \in [m]$, it holds that $\mathcal{N}_S(t) \leq t$, where $\mathcal{N}_S(t)$ denotes the number of arc endpoints in $S$ with value at most $t$, counting each endpoint as many times as it appears across different arcs in $S$.
\end{definition}




\begin{example}\label{example:dspr}
        Consider an instance of the \dspr with domes \linebreak$D= \{(2,3,4,5), (3,4), (4,5,9,10), (7,8)\}$ and $m=10$. A valid solution for this instance is $S= \{(2,5), (3,4), (5,9),(7,8)\}$. For example, when $t=5$, we have $\mathcal{N}_S(t) = 5$, which is no more than $t$. 
        In particular, selected endpoints $\leq t$ are $\{2,5,3,4,5\}$.   
        Note that there are two endpoints with a value of $5$, which belong to two different arcs.
\end{example}

Next, we explain how the \tis problem reduces to the \dspr problem.

\subparagraph*{Construction.}
Given an arbitrary instance $\mathcal{I} = (I,r, m')$ of \tis, where $|I| = n'$ for some positive $n'$, we construct the corresponding instance $\mathcal{D} = (D,m)$ of \dspr as follows. For each twin pair of intervals $(I_i, \overline{I_i}) \in I$, where $I_i = (a', b')$ and $\overline{I_i} = (c', d')$, we construct a regular dome $D_i = (a_i,b_i,c_i,d_i)$ where $a_i = 6n'a', b_i = 6n'b'+3n', c_i = 6n'c',$ and $d_i = 6n'd'+3n'$. 
It is easy to verify that $D_i$ is indeed a dome, that is $b_i-a_i=d_i-c_i$ (see Observation~\ref{obs:indeeddome}).

We define $m$ to be a large enough horizon. In particular, we let $m = 164(n'm')^2$. For any $t \in [m]$ that is a multiple of $6n'$ and $t\leq 3n'(2m'+1)$, we further add $d(t)$ some singleton domes that all start at $t$ and end at $m$. In other words, we add $d(t)$ identical singleton domes $(t,m)$. Next, we explain how $d(t)$ is defined.  For convenience, we let $d(t) = 0$ if $t$ is not a multiple of $6n'$ or $t> 3n'(2m'+1)$. Suppose $t$ is indeed a multiple of $6n'$.
The idea is to define $d(t)$ in a way to project the requirements imposed by the restriction function $r$ in $\mathcal{I}$ to the requirement $\mathcal{N}_S(t)\leq t$ in \dspr.


Let $\mathfrak{D}_i^t$ be the set of regular domes with exactly $i$ endpoints before or at point $t$, and define $c(t) = 2|\mathfrak{D}_4^t| + |\mathfrak{D}_3^t| + |\mathfrak{D}_2^t|$. 
\begin{example}
   For $t = 18$, dome $(1,4,5,8) \in \mathfrak{D}_4^t$, dome $(11,14,16,19)\in \mathfrak{D}_3^t$, dome $(9,10,26,27) \in \mathfrak{D}_2^t$, dome $(17,20,21,24)\in \mathfrak{D}_1^t$, and dome $(25,26,27,28) \in \mathfrak{D}_0^t$. Figure~\ref{fig:dometypes} provides an illustration.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{figures/Dome_types.pdf}
	\caption{An example of different types of domes based on their positions relative to $t=18$}
	\label{fig:dometypes}
\end{figure}

Intuitively, this definition of $c$ implies that there are $c(t)$ arc endpoints with value at most $t$ in any valid solution $S$ (a set of arcs), 
regardless of the choices made to form $S$. This is because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (i) all arc endpoints of domes in $\mathfrak{D}^t_4$ are at most $t$, and two of them (associated with one arc) contribute to $c(t)$.
    \item (ii) three arc endpoints of domes in $\mathfrak{D}^t_3$ are at most $t$, and any such dome contributes at least 1 to $c(t)$. \item 
(iii) the left endpoints of both arcs of domes in $\mathfrak{D}^t_2$, and since one arc is in $S$, the dome contributes exactly $1$ to $c(t)$.  
\end{itemize}

Finally, we let 

\scalebox{.9}{
\begin{minipage}{1.2\textwidth}
\begin{align*}
d(t) = t - c(t) - \sum_{j < t} d(j) - r(t/(6n')).
\end{align*}
\vspace{1mm}
\end{minipage}}
The scaling argument that is applied when forming the \dspr instance from \tis instance ensures that $d(t)$ is indeed non-negative for any $t\in [m]$ (see Observatio~\ref{obs:dt_nonnegative} for details).
This completes our construction of the \dspr instance. In a nutshell, we have added one regular dome per twin interval in the \tis instance, and for any $t\in[m]$, we added extra identical singleton domes to capture the requirements imposed by the restriction function in the \tis instance. 

\begin{example}
\label{example::drpsrTis}
    Consider an instance $\mathcal{I} = (I,r,m')$ of the \tis problem with \linebreak $I = \{((1,3)(4,6)),((2,3),(5,6)), ((2,3),(4,5))\}$ and $m'=6$. Suppose $r(1)=r(2)=r(6)=3$,  $r(3)=r(4)=1$, and $r(5)=2$. The corresponding instance $\mathcal{D}=(D,m)$ of \dspr has regular domes $D= \{(18,63,72,117),(36,63,90,117),(36,63,72,99)\}$ and $m=164(n'm')^2=164\cdot(3\cdot6)^2 = 53,136$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:dsprTis}). In addition, $3n'(2m'+1) = 117$ for any $t \in [1,117]$ that is a multiple of $6n'=18$, $d(t)$ singleton domes $(t,m)$ are added. Some examples of $d(t)$ are shown as follows.

    \scalebox{.9}{
    \begin{minipage}{1.2\textwidth}
    \begin{align*}
        &d(18)=18-0-0-3=15&&c(18)=0\\
        &d(36)=36-0-15-3=18&&c(36)=0\\
        &d(54)=54-0-(18+15)-1=20&&c(54)=0\\
        &d(72)=72-3-(15+18+20)-1=15 &&c(72)=3\\
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}}
\end{example}

\subparagraph*{Correctness.}
First, we provide some intuitions about the correctness of the reduction. 
We show that any valid solution $S$ for instance $\mathcal{D}$ of \dspr bijects to a valid solution $S'$ of $\mathcal{I}$. 
Note that $S$ contains exactly one arc, the inner or the outer arc, of each regular dome $D_i$ of $\mathcal{D}$ (in addition to singleton domes, which are contained in any valid solution for $\mathcal{D}$). Now, $S'$
selects the left interval $I_i$ when the outer arc of $D_i$ is selected in $S$ and the right interval $\overline{I_i}$ when the inner arc of $D_i$ is selected in $S$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:dsprTis}).
We let $\Gamma_{S'}(t')$ denote the number of intervals selected by $S'$ that include $t'\in [m']$.
We show that $S$ is a valid solution for $\mathcal{D}$ if and only if $S'$ is a valid solution to $\mathcal{I}$.

Solid lines show the selected intervals in a valid solution of $\mathcal{I}$ and the selected arcs in the corresponding solution in $\mathcal{D}$.}
    \label{fig:dsprTis}
\end{figure}

Suppose $S$ is a valid solution for \dspr. Then we must have $\mathcal{N}_S(t) \leq t$ for any $t\in[m]$, where $\mathcal{N}_S(t)$ is the number of arc endpoints in $S$ with value at most $t$. As mentioned earlier, $c(t)$ endpoints will be present in any valid solution regardless of the choices to form $S$. Moreover, $S$ must contain all endpoints of singleton domes in $\mathcal{D}$ for $j\leq t$. That is, any valid solution for $\mathcal{D}$, including $S$, must contain $c(t) + \sum_{j\leq t} d(j) $ arc endpoints.  
In addition to these fixed points, there will be more arcs in $S$, which are contributed by the domes in $\mathfrak{D}^t_1$ and $\mathfrak{D}^t_3$ as follows.
    Let $D_i$ be a regular dome in $\mathcal{D}$, and let $(I_i,\overline{I}_i)$ be its corresponding twin intervals in $\mathcal{I}$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Suppose $D_i\in \mathfrak{D}^t_1$. Now, if  
    $S$ contains the inner 
    arc of $D_i$, the contribution of $D_i$ to $\mathcal{N}_S(t)$ would be $0$. 
    This is equivalent to including the right interval $\overline{I_i}$ in $S'$, and thus 
    the 
    twin interval $(I_i,\overline{I_i})$ does not contribute $\Gamma_{S'}(t')$ for $t'=t/6n$. Informally, the contribution of the dome $D_i$ to the left-hand side of inequality $N_S(t) \leq t$ and the contribution of $(I_i,\overline{I_i})$ to the left-hand side of the inequality $\Gamma_{S'}(t')\leq r(t')$ 
    will be both $0$. 
    Similarly, if $S$ contains the outer arc of $D_i$, the contribution of $D_i$ to $\mathcal{N}_S(t)$ would be $1$.
    This is equivalent to including the left interval $\overline{I_i}$ in the \tis instance, and  $(I_i,\overline{I_i})$ contribute $1$ item to 
    $\Gamma_{S'}(t')$. Informally, the contribution of the dome $D_i$ to the left-hand side of inequality $\mathcal{N}_S(t) \leq t$ and the contribution of $(I_i,\overline{I_i})$ to the left-hand side of 
    $\Gamma_{S'}(t/{(6n')}) \leq r(t')$
    will be both $1$.  

    \item Suppose $D_i\in \mathfrak{D}^t_3$. Assume $S$ contains the inner (respectively the outer) arc of $D_i$. In this case, in addition to the fixed $1$ unit of the contribution of $D_i$ to $\mathcal{N}_S(t)$ (captured in $c(t)$), it further contributes $1$ (respectively $0$) unit to $\mathcal{N}_S(t)$. 
    This is equivalent to including the right interval $\overline{I}_i$ (respectively the left interval $I_i$) in $S'$. 
    In this case, the number of selected intervals in $S'$ that intersect $t$ is increased by $1$ (respectively $0$). Intuitively, both left-hand sides of $\mathcal{N}_S(t) \leq t$ and $\Gamma_{S'}(t/{(6n')}) \leq r(t')$ increase by $1$ (respectively $0$). 
\end{itemize}

We note that $n=|D|$ is polynomial in both $n'$ and $m'$, and thus $m=164(n'm')^2$ is polynomial in $n$. Therefore, we can conclude the following lemma, which establishes the NP-hardness of \dspr. We start the formal proof with the following observation showing that the regular domes in $\mathcal{D}$ are indeed valid. 

\begin{observation}\label{obs:indeeddome}
For any $i\in[n']$, any constructed $D_i = (a_i,b_i,c_i,d_i)$ in the reduction is a valid dome, i.e., $b_i - a_i = d_i - c_i$. 
\end{observation}
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 12}\end{proof}


Next, we observe that the number $d(t)$ of extra singleton domes added for any $t\in [m]$ is non-negative.

\begin{observation}\label{obs:dt_nonnegative}
   In the construction of $\mathcal{D}$ from $\mathcal{I}$, for any $t\in [m]$, we have $d(t) \geq 0$. 
\end{observation}
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 13}\end{proof}

For each dome $D_i \in D$, let the boolean variable $x_i$ indicate whether the outer arc of $D_i$ is selected in $S$ or not. Specifically, $x_i = 1$ means the outer arc is selected, while $\neg{x_i} = 1$ means the inner arc is selected. 

The following two lemma express the values of $\mathcal{N}_S(t)$ and $\Gamma_{S'}(t)$ in a way that allows us to relate a solution $S$ for the \dspr instance $\mathcal{D}$ to its associated solution $S'$ in the \tis instance $\mathcal{I}$. These lemmas will later help us in proving the correctness of the reduction. 

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:tool:TIS2DOME}
Let $\mathcal{D}=(D,m)$ be the \dspr problem constructed from an instance $\mathcal{I}$ of the \tis problem, and let $S$ be a multiset of arcs that contains exactly one arc from each dome $D_i \in D$. For any $t\in[m-1]$, the number of arc endpoints in $S$ with value at most $t$ is exactly $\mathcal{N}_S(t) = \sum_{i \in \mathfrak{D}_1^t} x_i + \sum_{i \in \mathfrak{D}_3^t} \neg{x_i} +|\mathfrak{D}_2^t| +|\mathfrak{D}_3^t| + 2|\mathfrak{D}_4^t| + \sum_{j \leq t} d(j)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 14}\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:gamUpBound}
Let $\mathcal{D}=(D,m)$ be the \dspr problem constructed from an instance $\mathcal{I}=(I,r,m')$ of the \tis problem, and let $S'$ be a selection of intervals from $\mathcal{I}$ that contains exactly one interval from each twin interval $(I_i,\overline{I_i}) \in I$. 
For any $t'\in[m-1]$, we have 
$\Gamma_{S'}(t') = \sum_{i \in \mathfrak{D}_3^t} \neg{x_i} +  \sum_{i \in \mathfrak{D}_1^t} x_i  $, where $t=6n't'$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 15}\end{proof}

Now, we are ready to prove the correctness of the reduction. 

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:DSPR2TIS}
If the answer to the instance $\mathcal{D}=(D,m)$ of \dspr is yes, then the answer to its corresponding instance $\mathcal{I}=(I,r,m')$ of \tis is also yes. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 16}\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:TIS2DSPR}
If the answer to the instance $\mathcal{I}=(I,r,m')$ of \tis is yes, then the answer to its corresponding instance $\mathcal{D}=(D,m)$ of \dspr is also yes.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 17}\end{proof}

From the above lemmas, we can conclude the main result of this section.
\begin{restatable}{lemma}{Domeishard}\label{thm:TIS2DOME}
Answering instances $(D,m)$ of the \dspr problem is NP-hard even if $m$ is polynomial in $|D|$.

 \subsection{Hardness of \telebg in \Flower Graphs} \label{subsection:telebghard}

We refer to the decision variant of the broadcasting problem as the \telebg problem with instances $(G,s,\rho)$, where $G$ is the input graph, $s$ is the source, and $\rho$ is a positive integer. The decision question asks whether it is possible to complete broadcasting in $G$ from $s$ within $\rho$ rounds. This section presents our final reduction, from \cds to \telebg in \flower graphs. 


\subparagraph*{Construction.} 
Given an instance $\mathcal{D}=(D,m)$ of \cds we construct an instance $\mathcal{T}=(G, r, \rho=2m)$ of \telebg, where $G$ is a \flower graph with \pistil $r$. For a given $x \in [\rho]$, let $\tilde{x} = \rho - x$. We construct the graph $G$ by creating a \cater (see Definition~\ref{def:ourflowergraph}) for each dome in $\mathcal{D}$ as follows. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \cater of a singleton dome $(a,b)$ is a path of length $2\tilde{a}+2\tilde{b}$ with endpoints $p$ and $q$ (here, $p,q,z$ are special vertices in the \cater, where $z$ is any arbitrary vertex). 
    \item The \cater of a regular dome $(a,b,c,d)$ is formed by a path of length $2\tilde{b}+2\tilde{d}+1$ with endpoints $p$ and $q$, which are two special vertices of the \cater. The other special vertex $z$ of the \cater is the vertex at distance $2\tilde{b}$ of $p$ (and thus distance $2\tilde{d}$ of $q$). In addition to the vertices on the path between $p$ and $q$, the \cater includes $\tilde{a} - \tilde{b}$ (which equals $\tilde{c}-\tilde{d}$) other vertices which find $z$ as their sole neighbor.
    \end{itemize}

    \end{minipage}
    \caption{An illustration of the construction of the \telebr instance corresponding to a \cds instance}
    \label{fig:domes_cdsToB}
\end{figure}

For any \cater $C$ constructed above (from either a singleton or a regular dome), we label the vertex at distances $\tilde{a}$ form $p$ as the \emph{first gate} of $C$, denoted as $u$, and the one at distance $\tilde{b}$ from $q$ as the \emph{second gate of} $C$ and denote it with $v$. We form the equivalent instance of the \telebg problem by forming a graph $G$ with a \pistil vertex $r$ (source) that is connected to all gates of all reduced caterpillars formed by the domes of $D$. By Definition~\ref{def:ourflowergraph}, $G$ will be a \flower graph with center $r$. Figure~\ref{fig:domes_cdsToB} provides an illustration of this reduction.

\subparagraph*{Correctness.}
Before proving the correctness of our reduction, we prove the following lemmas for broadcasting in the reduced caterpillars associated with singleton and regular domes, respectively. 

\begin{restatable}{lemma}{caterbr}\label{lemma:broudguess:singletondomeiff}
Consider a \cater $C$ of a singleton dome $D=(a,b)$ with gates $u$ and $v$. One can complete broadcasting in $C$ within $\rho$ rounds if and only if $u$ is informed no later than time $a$ and $v$ is informed no later than time $b$.
\end{restatable}
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 19}\end{proof}



\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:broudguess:regulardomeiff}
    Consider a \cater $C$ of a regular dome $D=(a,b,c,d)$ with gates $u$ and $v$. One can complete broadcasting in $C$ within $\rho$ rounds if and only if one of the following happens: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  (i) $u$ is informed by time $b$ and $v$ is informed by time $c$. 
        \item (ii) $u$ is informed by time $a$ and $v$ is informed by time $d$.
    \end{itemize}
   
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 20}\end{proof}

We are now ready to prove the main result of this section.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:hardness-flower}
    \telebr problem is NP-complete for \flower graphs.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 21}\end{proof}
  \section{Constant-Factor Approximation for Bounded Pathwidth}
\label{sec:pathwidth-approx}

Graphs of pathwidth $1$ are caterpillars~\cite{ProskurowskiT99}, which are special types of trees, for which the \telebr problem is solvable in linear time \cite{fraigniaud2002polynomial}. On the other hand, for graphs with a pathwidth larger than $1$, the \telebr problem is NP-hard, as established by our result for the hardness of the problem in \flower graphs (Theorem~\ref{thm:hardness-flower}). Recall that \flower graphs have pathwidth 2 (Observation~\ref{obs:flower-pathwidth}). 

In this section, we establish the existence of a constant-factor approximation for \telebr on graphs with bounded pathwidth. Recall that we use $\bropt(G,s)$
to denote the optimal broadcasting time for an instance $(G,s)$. We will demonstrate that the algorithm of~\citet{elkin2006sublogarithmic}, which has an approximation factor of $\oh\left(\frac{\log n}{\log \bropt(G, s)}\right)$ for any graph $G$, achieves a constant factor approximation for graphs of bounded pathwidth. For general graphs, this algorithm has an approximation factor of $\oh(\log n/ \log \log n)$ (because $\bropt(G,s)\geq  \log n$), which is the best known approximation factor.  

For any graph $G$ of pathwidth $\pwidth$, we will show that $\bropt(G,s) = \Omega(n^{4^{-(\pwidth+1)}})$, which establishes that the algorithm of~\citet{elkin2006sublogarithmic} has a constant factor approximation for graphs of bounded pathwidth $\pwidth$.



To find a lower bound for $\bropt(G,s)$ where $G$ is a graph of constant pathwidth, we repeatedly remove a vertex from $G$ and show that the broadcasting in the remainder of $G$ is not much slower compared to $G$. For that, we will use the following lemma, which holds for any instance of \telebr (but we only use it for graphs of bounded pathwidth). 

\begin{restatable}{lemma}{constantBRminus}\label{lemma:brminus}
Consider any instance $(G,s)$ of \telebr, and let $v$ be any arbitrary vertex in $G$. Let $H_1,\ldots, H_m$ be the connected components resulting from removing $v$ from $G$ ($m\geq 1$). 
For any $i \in [m]$, choose an arbitrary vertex $s_i\in H_i$.
Then, the following inequality holds: $\sum_{i\in[m]} \bropt(H_i, s_i) \leq \bropt(G,s)(2\bropt(G,s) + 1)$.
\end{restatable}




\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 22}\end{proof}

For completeness, we show that Lemma~\ref{lemma:brminus} is asymptotically tight. 

\begin{observation}\label{observation:tighti}
    There are instances of the \telebr problem $(G,s)$ and vertex $v \in G$ for which Lemma~\ref{lemma:brminus} is asymptotically tight.
\end{observation}

\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 23}\end{proof}

\begin{figure}

    \label{fig:fangraph-example}
\end{figure}

The main result of this section can be stated as follows.

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{constanttheorem}\label{thm:approximation-constant}
There is a polynomial-time algorithm for \telebr in graphs with constant pathwidth $\pwidth$, achieving an approximation ratio of $\oh(4^{\pwidth})$.
\end{restatable}

\paragraph{Proof Overview.}
As mentioned above, it suffices to prove a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{4^{-(w+1)}})$ for $\bropt(G,s)$. 
For that, we assume $G$ is a ``$\pwidth$-path'' in the sense that any two vertices that share a bag are neighbors. If $G$ is not a $\pwidth$-path, we will add the missing edges to get a $\pwidth$-path without increasing the pathwidth.
 Clearly, the addition of new edges does not decrease the broadcast time of $G$, and since we are looking for a lower bound for the broadcast time, it suffices to focus on $\pwidth$-paths.

We assume a \emph{standard path decomposition} of the input graph $G$, in which no bag is a subset of another. In such decompositions, we define the notion of \emph{span} of a vertex $v$ as the number of bags where $v$ appears. The span of a decomposition is then the maximum span over the spans of all its vertices. 

The proof of lemma is established by induction over the size of the input graph $G$. For that, we consider two cases. First, if the span of the decomposition is ``small'', we argue that the diameter of $G$ will be ``large'', and then the desired lower bound for $\bropt(G,s)$ holds.
On the other hand, when the span is ``large'', we consider the vertex $v_m$ that has the maximum span and  
consider the graph $G_{v_m}$ induced by vertices that share a bag with $v_m$. Note that $G_{v_m}$ is a smaller graph compared to $G$, and we can show that broadcasting in $G_{v_m}$, starting from any vertex, cannot be much slower than broadcasting in $G$, starting from $s$ (Lemma~\ref{lemma:br:inducedHG}). 
Moreover, we will use Lemma~\ref{lemma:brminus} to show that if we extract $v_m$ from $G_{v_m}$ to get a set $\{H_1,\ldots, H_q\}$ of disjoint connected components, total broadcast time in these component components (starting from arbitrary sources) is not much slower in the absence of $v_m$. On the other hand, since $v_m$ is removed from $G_{v_m}$, any of these components $H_i$ has a pathwidth that is at least one unit less than $G_{v_m}$, and we can use an inductive argument to achieve a lower bound on the broadcast times of any $H_i$ (Lemma~\ref{lemma:brlbsonleft}). In summary, by the induction hypothesis, total broadcast time in $H_i$'s gives a lower bound for broadcasting in $G_{v_m}$ which itself gives a lower bound for broadcasting in $G$. 


Now for the formal proof, we prove a lower bound for the broadcast time of any connected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and pathwidth $\pwidth \in \oh(1)$. In particular, for any $s\in G$, we will show $\bropt(G,s) \in \Omega(n^{4^{-\pwidth}})$.
Consider a fixed path decomposition of $G$; we assume the bags in the deposition are arranged from left to right. For now, suppose $s$ is in the left-most bag (this assumption will be relaxed later in Lemma~\ref{lemma:brlbsonleft}). 

We assume the path decomposition is ``standard'' in the sense that no bag is a subset of another bag (otherwise, one can remove the smaller bags to attain a standard decomposition). Finally, we assume that $G$ is a ``$\pwidth$-path'' in the sense that any two vertices located in the same bag are connected in $G$ (all edges allowed in the decomposition are present). If the input graph is not a $\pwidth$-path, we can make it $\pwidth$-path by adding all the missing edges. Clearly, the addition of new edges does not decrease the broadcast time of $G$, and since we are looking for a lower bound for the broadcast time, it suffices to focus on $\pwidth$-paths. 

We now proceed with a formal proof.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:br:inducedHG}
    Let $(H,s)$ be an instance of the broadcast problem, where $H$ is a connected $\pwidth$-path. Suppose we have a standard path decomposition $D$ of width $\pwidth$ for $H$ where $s$ appears in the first bag of $D$. Let $G$ be an induced subgraph of $H$ formed by vertices that appear in a consecutive set of bags in $D$ and suppose a vertex $s'\in G$ appears in all such bags. Then, we can write $\bropt(G,s') \leq \bropt(H,s)+2\pwidth$.
\end{lemma}
    
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 24}\end{proof}

    \label{fig:decomposition_bag_graphs}
\end{figure}

To establish a lower bound for broadcasting in any connected $\pwidth$-path graph $G$, we prove a slightly stronger result. Suppose we have $k$ connected $\pwidth$-path graphs $H_1, H_2,\ldots, H_k$, each $H_i$ having at least two vertices, a standard path decomposition of width  $\pwidth$ and a vertex $s_i \in H_i$ located at the left-most bag in its decomposition. We prove a lower bound for the total time for broadcasting in these graphs as follows. This is a generalization of our desired lower bound for the case of $k=1$.


\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:brlbsonleft}
    Consider a set of $k\geq 1$ vertex disjoint connected $\pwidth$-path graphs $\mathcal{H} = \{H_1, \ldots, H_k\}$. Suppose any $H_i$ has a standard path decomposition $D_i$ with $\ell_i$ bags, where a source vertex $s_i$ is located in the leftmost bag of $D_i$. Let $\bigell = \sum_{i=1}^k \ell_i$. 
    Then we have
    $\sum_{i=1}^k \bropt(H_i, s_i) \geq f(\bigell, \pwidth)$, where $f(\bigell, \pwidth) = 27^{-\pwidth}(\pwidth!)^{-2}\bigell^{4^{-\pwidth}}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 25}\end{proof}


The following lemma generalizes Lemma~\ref{lemma:brlbsonleft} (applied with $k=1$) to the case where the source is not necessarily located in the first bag of the path decomposition.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:pwidth-ell}
   Let $G$ be any connected graph 
   and 
   let $s$ be any vertex of $G$. Suppose $G$ has a standard path decomposition of width $\pwidth$ formed by $\bigell$ bags. Then, we have $\bropt(G,s) \geq f(\bigell-1,\pwidth+1)$, where $f(\bigell, \pwidth) = 27^{-\pwidth}(\pwidth!)^{-2}\bigell^{4^{-\pwidth}}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}\textcolor{red}{TOPROVE 26}\end{proof}

We are now ready to prove the main result of this section.

 \section{Concluding Remarks}\label{section:concluding}

In this paper, we resolved an open problem by proving the NP-completeness of \telebr for cactus graphs as well as graphs of pathwidth $2$. We also established a $2$-approximation algorithm for cactus graphs and a constant-factor approximation algorithm for graphs of bounded pathwidth. A possible direction for future work is to improve the approximation factor for graphs of bounded pathwidth or cactus graphs. In particular, it remains an open question whether Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (PTASs) exist for these graph classes. A major open problem in this domain is determining whether a constant-factor approximation exists for general graphs. While progress on this question has been slow, the algorithmic ideas developed in this work may be applicable to broadcasting in other families of sparse graphs.
