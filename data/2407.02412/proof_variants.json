      "text": "To prove the first property, observe that any path from $t$ to $b$ in $H_n$ must pass sequentially through the $n$ copies of the interior gadget $I$. Within any single copy of $I$, the vertices $t_I$ and $b_I$ are distinct, so the distance between them is at least 1. As a path from $t$ to $b$ must traverse all $n$ such gadgets, the total distance is at least the sum of these minimal distances, which means $\\mathrm{dist}_{H_n}(b, t) \\geq n$.\n\nFor the second property, we know that $k$-leaf powers are strongly chordal. Since the three types of gadgets ($\\mathrm{Top}$, $\\mathrm{Bot}$, and $I$) are all $k$-leaf powers, they are inherently strongly chordal. The construction of $H_n$ involves identifying vertices from these gadgets, a process that does not introduce any new cycles. Therefore, the resulting graph $H_n$ must also be strongly chordal.\n\nTo establish the third property, we will construct $k$-leaf roots for $H_n - \\mathrm{Top}$ and $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$, as depicted in Figure 2, by combining the leaf-root trees provided by the gadgets.\n\nFirst, consider $H_n - \\mathrm{Top}$. Its $k$-leaf root, shown as the left tree in Figure 2, is constructed by taking $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ and merging it with $n$ copies of the tree $T_I$, which we label $T_I^1, \\dots, T_I^n$. The merging is done as follows: we identify vertex $t$ of $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ with vertex $t_I^1$ of $T_I^1$, and we also identify their respective parent vertices. Then, for each $j$ from 1 to $n-1$, we identify vertex $b_I^j$ of $T_I^j$ with vertex $t_I^{j+1}$ of $T_I^{j+1}$, along with their parents. The individual gadgets are correctly represented as $k$-leaf powers of their corresponding subtrees. We only need to show that this merging process does not create any unwanted edges between vertices from different original subtrees.\nConsider a leaf $v_1$ of $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ (with $v_1 \\neq t$) and a leaf $v_2$ of $T_I^1$ (with $v_2 \\neq t_I^1$). From Lemma 2.1, we have $d(v_1, t) \\geq m_{T_{\\mathrm{Top}}}(t) = 3$. From the second point of Lemma 2.3, we have $d(v_2, t_I^1) \\geq m_{T_I}(t_I) = k$. The distance between them in the combined tree is thus at least $d(v_1, t) + d(v_2, t_I^1) - 2 \\geq 3+k-2 = k+1$. Since this distance is greater than $k$, no edge is formed between $v_1$ and $v_2$.\nA similar argument applies to the connection between two consecutive interior trees, $T_I^j$ and $T_I^{j+1}$ (for $j < n$). If $v_1$ is a leaf of $T_I^j$ other than $b_I^j$ and $v_2$ is a leaf of $T_I^{j+1}$ other than $t_I^{j+1}$, their distances to the identified connection point ($b_I^j = t_I^{j+1}$) are at least 3 and $k$, respectively. Their distance in the merged tree is therefore at least $d(v_1, b_I^j) + d(v_2, t_I^{j+1}) - 2 \\geq 3+k-2 = k+1$, which is greater than $k$, so no edge is formed. This confirms that the constructed tree is a valid $k$-leaf root for $H_n - \\mathrm{Top}$.\n\nNext, consider $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$. Its $k$-leaf root, shown as the right tree in Figure 2, is formed by joining $n$ copies of the tree $R_I$, labeled $R_I^1, \\dots, R_I^n$, with the tree $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$. For each $j$ from 1 to $n-1$, we identify vertex $b_I^j$ of $R_I^j$ with vertex $t_I^{j+1}$ of $R_I^{j+1}$, including their parents. Finally, we identify $b_I^n$ of $R_I^n$ with $b$ of $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$ and their parents. Again, we must verify that no unwanted edges are introduced.\nConsider leaves $v_1$ in $R_I^j$ ($v_1 \\neq b_I^j$) and $v_2$ in $R_I^{j+1}$ ($v_2 \\neq t_I^{j+1}$). According to Lemma 2.3, their distances to the connection point ($b_I^j = t_I^{j+1}$) are at least $m_{R_I}(b_I)=4$ and $m_{R_I}(t_I)=k-1$, respectively. Their distance in the combined tree is at least $d(v_1, b_I^j) + d(v_2, t_I^{j+1}) - 2 \\geq 4 + (k-1) - 2 = k+1 > k$, so no edge is created.\nNow consider the final connection between $R_I^n$ and $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$. Let $v_1$ be a leaf of $R_I^n$ ($v_1 \\neq b_I^n$) and $v_2$ be a leaf of $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$ ($v_2 \\neq b$). Their distances to the identified vertex ($b_I^n=b$) are at least $d(v_1, b_I^n) \\geq 4$ (by Lemma 2.3) and $d(v_2, b) \\geq k-1$ (by Lemma 2.2). The distance between them is at least $d(v_1, b_I^n) + d(v_2, b) - 2 \\geq 4 + (k-1) - 2 = k+1 > k$. No edge is formed. This completes the proof of the third property.\n\nFinally, we prove the fourth property. We begin with an inductive proof for a helper claim: for any integer $n$, every $k$-leaf root $T$ of the graph $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ must contain a leaf at distance 3 from the vertex $b$.\nFor the base case $n=0$, the graph $H_0 - \\mathrm{Bot}$ consists only of the $\\mathrm{Top}$ gadget, making $b$ and $t$ the same vertex. By property 1 of Lemma 2.1, the claim holds.\nFor the inductive step, assume the property is true for some $n \\geq 0$, and let $T$ be a $k$-leaf root of $H_{n+1} - \\mathrm{Bot}$. Because $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ is an induced subgraph of $H_{n+1} - \\mathrm{Bot}$, the tree $T$ contains an induced subtree that is a $k$-leaf root of $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a vertex $v_1$ in $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ with distance exactly 3 from $b_I^n$ (which is the vertex $t_I^{n+1}$ in the larger graph). This distance remains 3 in $T$, so $d(v_1, t_I^{n+1}) = 3$.\nWe claim that every vertex of the final gadget $I^{n+1}$ (except for $t_I^{n+1}$ itself) is at a distance of at least $k$ from $t_I^{n+1}$ in $T$. Assume for contradiction that there is a vertex $v_2$ in $I^{n+1}$, with $v_2 \\neq t_I^{n+1}$, such that $d(v_2, t_I^{n+1}) \\leq k-1$. This implies that the distance between $v_1$ and $v_2$ in $T$ is bounded by $d(v_1, v_2) \\leq d(v_1, t_I^{n+1}) + d(v_2, t_I^{n+1}) - 2 \\leq 3 + (k-1) - 2 = k$. This distance would create an edge between $v_1$ and $v_2$ in the $k$-leaf power, but no such edge exists in $H_{n+1} - \\mathrm{Bot}$, which is a contradiction. Thus, all vertices in $I^{n+1}$ other than $t_I^{n+1}$ are at distance at least $k$ from it in $T$. With this established, we can apply property 1 of Lemma 2.3, which concludes the induction.\n\nNow, assume for the sake of contradiction that $H_n$ has a $k$-leaf root $T$. This tree $T$ must also serve as a $k$-leaf root for the induced subgraph $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$. Based on the result just proven by induction, there must exist a vertex $v_1$ in $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ such that $d(b_I^n, v_1) = 3$. Furthermore, property 1 of Lemma 2.2 guarantees that there is a vertex $v_2$ in the $\\mathrm{Bot}$ gadget, with $v_2 \\neq b$, such that $d(v_2, b) \\leq k-1$. In the graph $H_n$, the vertices $b_I^n$ and $b$ are the same. We can therefore bound the distance between $v_1$ and $v_2$ in $T$: $d(v_1, v_2) \\leq d(v_1, b) + d(v_2, b) - 2 \\leq 3 + (k-1) - 2 = k$. This distance implies that an edge exists between $v_1$ and $v_2$ in the $k$-leaf power of $T$. However, no such edge exists in $H_n$, as $v_1$ is in $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ and $v_2$ is in $\\mathrm{Bot}$. This contradiction proves that our initial assumption was false, and $H_n$ is not a $k$-leaf power.",

      "text": "To prove property 1, we observe that any path from $b$ to $t$ must pass through each of the $n$ copies of the interior gadget $I$. Within each such copy, the distance between its entry vertex $t_I$ and exit vertex $b_I$ is at least 1. Summing over all $n$ copies, we find that $\\mathrm{dist}_{H_n}(b, t) \\geq n$.\n\nFor property 2, the component gadgets $\\mathrm{Top}$, $\\mathrm{Bot}$, and $I$ are $k$-leaf powers and therefore are strongly chordal. The graph $H_n$ is formed by connecting these gadgets in a linear sequence, a construction that does not create new chordless cycles. Thus, $H_n$ is also strongly chordal.\n\nTo establish property 3, we construct explicit $k$-leaf roots for $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ and $H_n - \\mathrm{Top}$ by joining the leaf roots of the constituent gadgets, namely $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$, $T_I$, and $R_I$, as illustrated in Figure 2.\n\nFirst, a $k$-leaf root for $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ is constructed from $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ and $n$ copies of $T_I$, denoted $T_I^1, \\dots, T_I^n$. The leaf $t$ in $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ and its parent are identified with the leaf $t_I^1$ in $T_I^1$ and its parent. For $1 \\leq j < n$, the leaf $b_I^j$ in $T_I^j$ and its parent are identified with the leaf $t_I^{j+1}$ in $T_I^{j+1}$ and its parent. We must verify that this construction creates no unintended edges. Consider a leaf $v_1 \\neq t$ in $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ and a leaf $v_2 \\neq t_I^1$ in $T_I^1$. From Lemma 2.1, $d(v_1, t) \\geq 3$, and from Lemma 2.3, $d(v_2, t_I^1) \\geq k$. The distance between them in the composite tree is $d(v_1, v_2) = d(v_1, t) + d(v_2, t_I^1) - 2 \\geq 3 + k - 2 = k+1 > k$. Similarly, for $1 \\leq j < n$, consider a leaf $v_1 \\neq b_I^j$ in $T_I^j$ and a leaf $v_2 \\neq t_I^{j+1}$ in $T_I^{j+1}$. We have $d(v_1, b_I^j) \\geq 3$ and $d(v_2, t_I^{j+1}) \\geq k$, so $d(v_1, v_2) \\geq 3 + k - 2 = k+1 > k$. In all cases, no unwanted edge is formed.\n\nSecond, a $k$-leaf root for $H_n - \\mathrm{Top}$ is formed by merging $n$ copies of $R_I$, denoted $R_I^1, \\dots, R_I^n$, with $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$. For $1 \\leq j < n$, the leaf $b_I^j$ of $R_I^j$ and its parent are identified with the leaf $t_I^{j+1}$ of $R_I^{j+1}$ and its parent. Finally, $b_I^n$ of $R_I^n$ and its parent are identified with $b$ of $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$ and its parent. To check for spurious edges, first take a leaf $v_1 \\neq b_I^j$ in $R_I^j$ and a leaf $v_2 \\neq t_I^{j+1}$ in $R_I^{j+1}$ for some $j < n$. By Lemma 2.3, $d(v_1, b_I^j) \\geq 4$ and $d(v_2, t_I^{j+1}) \\geq k-1$. Their distance is $d(v_1, v_2) \\geq 4 + (k-1) - 2 = k+1 > k$. Next, take a leaf $v_1 \\neq b_I^n$ in $R_I^n$ and a leaf $v_2 \\neq b$ in $T_{\\mathrm{Bot}}$. We have $d(v_1, b_I^n) \\geq 4$ from Lemma 2.3 and $d(v_2, b) \\geq k-1$ from Lemma 2.2. Their distance is $d(v_1, v_2) \\geq 4 + (k-1) - 2 = k+1 > k$. No unintended edges are created, which completes the proof of property 3.\n\nFor property 4, we first prove by induction on $n$ that in any $k$-leaf root $T$ of $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$, there exists a leaf at distance exactly 3 from the leaf corresponding to $b_I^n$. For the base case $n=0$, $H_0 - \\mathrm{Bot}$ is just the $\\mathrm{Top}$ gadget, and since $b$ is identified with $t$, the property holds by Lemma 2.1. For the inductive step, assume the property holds for $n$ and consider a $k$-leaf root $T$ of $H_{n+1} - \\mathrm{Bot}$. The leaves of $T$ corresponding to $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ form a $k$-leaf root of this subgraph. By the induction hypothesis, there is a leaf $v_1$ in $T$ at distance 3 from the leaf for $b_I^n = t_I^{n+1}$. Now, let $v_2$ be any leaf in $T$ corresponding to a vertex in $I^{n+1} \\setminus \\{t_I^{n+1}\\}$. If we had $d_T(v_2, t_I^{n+1}) \\leq k-1$, the distance calculation $d_T(v_1, v_2) \\leq d_T(v_1, t_I^{n+1}) + d_T(v_2, t_I^{n+1}) - 2 \\leq 3 + (k-1) - 2 = k$ would imply an edge between vertices in different gadgets, a contradiction. Thus, every such leaf $v_2$ must be at distance at least $k$ from $t_I^{n+1}$. This condition, combined with Lemma 2.3 (property 1), implies there is a leaf at distance 3 from $b_I^{n+1}$, which completes the induction.\n\nNow, assume for contradiction that $H_n$ has a $k$-leaf root $T$. The graph $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ is an induced subgraph of $H_n$, so its corresponding leaves in $T$ form a $k$-leaf root. By the claim just proved, there is a leaf $v_1$ such that $d_T(v_1, b_I^n) = 3$. From the properties of the $\\mathrm{Bot}$ gadget, Lemma 2.2 implies there is a leaf $v_2$ corresponding to a vertex in $\\mathrm{Bot} \\setminus \\{b\\}$ with $d_T(v_2, b) \\leq k-1$. In $H_n$, the vertex $b_I^n$ is identified with $b$. Thus, in $T$, the distance between $v_1$ and $v_2$ is at most $d_T(v_1, b) + d_T(b, v_2) - 2 \\leq 3 + (k-1) - 2 = k$. This would create an edge between a vertex in $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot} \\setminus \\{b_I^n\\}$ and a vertex in $\\mathrm{Bot}$, which does not exist in $H_n$. This contradiction establishes that $H_n$ is not a $k$-leaf power.",

The construction of $H_n$ by identifying vertices does not introduce any cycles, so $H_n$ is strongly chordal.\nFor property 3, we show that $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ and $H_n - \\mathrm{Top}$ are $k$-leaf powers by constructing their respective $k$-leaf roots.\nA $k$-leaf root for $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ is formed by taking $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$ and $n$ copies of the tree $T_I$, denoted $T_I^1, \\dots, T_I^n$.

This proves 3.\n\nFor property 4, we first prove by induction on $n$ that any $k$-leaf root $T$ of $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ has a leaf at distance 3 from the exit vertex $b_I^n$. For the base case $n=0$, $H_0 - \\mathrm{Bot} = \\mathrm{Top}$ and $b_I^0=t$; the property holds for the gadget $T_{\\mathrm{Top}}$. For the induction step, consider a $k$-leaf root $T'$ of $H_{n+1}-\\mathrm{Bot}$. By hypothesis, its induced subtree rooting $H_n - \\mathrm{Bot}$ has a leaf $v_1$ with $d_{T'}(v_1, b_I^n)=3$. Since $b_I^n$ is identified with $t_I^{n+1}$, any vertex $v_2 \\in V(I^{n+1})\\setminus\\{t_I^{n+1}\\}$ must be at distance at least $k$ from $t_I^{n+1}$ in $T'$.
